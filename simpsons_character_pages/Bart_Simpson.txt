'''Bartholomew Jo-Jo''' "'''Bart'''" '''Simpson''' is one of the main characters in the American animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' who is part of the [[Simpson family|titular family]]. Widely regarded as one of the greatest fictional characters of all time, he was named by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] as one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|most important people of the 20th century]].

Bart made his television debut in the [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]" on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] created and designed Bart while waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Initially called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'', Groening developed a new set of characters. Unlike the other Simpson family members, who were named after Groening's relatives, Bart's name is an [[anagram]] of ''brat''. After two years on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family received their own series, which premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on December 17, 1989. Bart has appeared in every episode of ''The Simpsons'' except "[[Four Great Women and a Manicure]]".

Always ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson]] and the brother of [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. Known for his penchant for mischief, rebelliousness and disrespect for authority, Bart's most iconic traits include his [[chalkboard gag]]s in the opening sequence, prank calls to [[Moe's Tavern]], and catchphrases like "Eat my shorts", "''[[¡Ay, caramba!]]''", "Don't have a cow, man!", and "I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?". Bart has also appeared in ''The Simpsons''{{'}}-related media, including [[List of The Simpsons video games|video games]], [[The Simpsons Movie|the 2007 film version of the series]], [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]], commercials, [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]], and an extensive line of [[merchandise]]. [[Nancy Cartwright]], Bart's voice actor, intended to audition for the role of Lisa, and [[Yeardley Smith]] auditioned for Bart. Smith's voice was deemed too high-pitched for a boy, while Cartwright found Lisa less appealing as a character and opted to try out for Bart—a role she felt better suited her.

Bart's [[protagonist]] status during the show's first two seasons led to "Bartmania", which spawned Bart-themed merchandise touting his rebellious persona and pride in underachieving. The traits were criticized by parents and educators, who viewed him as a negative influence on children. By the [[The Simpsons season 3|third season]], Homer became the show's figurehead character and the series shifted its focus to the family as a whole, although Bart remains a [[breakout character]]. He is considered one of the most iconic fictional television characters of the 1990s. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named him Entertainer of the Year in 1990. Cartwright has received accolades for her portrayal of Bart, including a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in 1992 and an [[Annie Award]] in 1995. In 2000, Bart and the rest of the Simpson family were honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

== Role in ''The Simpsons'' ==
''The Simpsons'' employs a [[floating timeline]], in which characters either do not age or age minimally; the show is always presumed to take place in the present year.{{sfn|Friedrich|Colmenares|2017|p=73}}{{sfn|Davis|Gilboy|Zborowski|2015|pages=175–188}} Always ten years old,<ref name="r412">{{cite web | last=Bernhardt | first=Jack | title=Ay Caramba!

During recess, Bart befriended [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] and began entertaining classmates with gestures and rude jokes. [[Principal Skinner]] warned Bart, "You've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow for the rest of your life! Now, what do you say?"
