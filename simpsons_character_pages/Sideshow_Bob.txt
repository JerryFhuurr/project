[...] PhD.}}</ref> better known as '''Sideshow Bob''', is a recurring character and the secondary antagonist in the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is voiced by [[Kelsey Grammer]] and first appeared in the episode "[[The Telltale Head]]". Bob is a self-proclaimed genius who is a graduate of [[Yale University]] and a champion of [[high culture]], including the adoption of a [[Northeastern elite accent|transatlantic accent]], similar to that of Grammer's portrayal of [[Dr. Frasier Crane]] from the sitcoms ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[Frasier]]''. He began his career as a sidekick on [[Krusty the Clown]]'s television show, but after enduring constant abuse, Bob framed his employer for armed robbery in "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]", only to be foiled by [[Bart Simpson]], and sent to prison. Bob started seeking revenge against Bart while in prison, and the two became feuding archenemies.

Bob made his second major appearance in [[The Simpsons season 3|season three]]'s "[[Black Widower]]"; the writers echoed the premise of [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner]] by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life, threatening to disrupt and end it through murder. Starting with that appearance and thereafter, Bob has assumed the role on ''The Simpsons'' of an [[villain|evil genius]]. Episodes in which he is a central character typically involve Sideshow Bob being released from prison and executing an elaborate revenge plan, usually foiled by Bart and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. His plans often involve death and destruction, usually targeted at Bart or, less often, Krusty, though he [[The Italian Bob|starts targeting]] the entire Simpson family in [[The Simpsons season 17|season 17]]. In [[The Simpsons season 27|season 27]], however, during the first segment of "[[Treehouse of Horror XXVI]]", entitled "Wanted: Dead, Then Alive", Bob finally gets his wish of killing Bart, commenting that he spent 24 years trying to kill a ten-year-old child; however, he becomes bored with Bart dead, so he brings him back to life so that he can repeatedly kill Bart over and over again.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=June 6, 2015 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/06/simpsons-sideshow-bob-kill-bart |title=The Simpsons scoop: Sideshow Bob to finally kill Bart this fall |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=June 11, 2015 |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221061519/http://ew.com/article/2015/06/06/simpsons-sideshow-bob-kill-bart/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Nicholson |first=Max |date=July 11, 2015 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/11/comic-con-2015-the-simpsons-panel-teases-new-treehouse-of-horror |title=Comic-Con 2015: The Simpsons Panel Teases New "Treehouse of Horror" |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=September 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=October 8, 2015 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/08/simpsons-treehouse-horror-sideshow-bob-ren-stimpy |title=Simpsons' 'Treehouse of Horror XXVI': First Look and details on Sideshow Bob killing Bart and more |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=October 11, 2015}}</ref>

Despite his villainous deeds, Sideshow Bob shares some personality traits of Grammer character Frasier Crane, and he has been described as "Frasier pickled in arsenic."<ref name="Arsenic"/> Several parallels have been explicitly drawn in ''The Simpsons'' between Bob and Frasier Crane—Bob's brother Cecil and his father were played by [[David Hyde Pierce]] and [[John Mahoney]], respectively, echoing the roles they played in ''Frasier''. Grammer, who based Bob's voice on that of actor [[Ellis Rabb]], has been praised for his portrayals of the character. In 2006, he won an Emmy for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] for his work in the episode "The Italian Bob".

As of season 36, Sideshow Bob has appeared in more than 40 episodes, had speaking appearances in 25 of these, and been featured as the main character in 15. The most recent of the latter, "[[The Yellow Lotus]]", aired during [[The Simpsons season 36|the 36th season]], and his most recent speaking appearance was in "[[Treehouse of Horror XXXIV]]" in [[The Simpsons season 35|the 35th season]].<ref>{{cite tweet |last=Price |first=Michael |user=mikepriceinla |number=1581713481124188160

He appears in the [[List of The Simpsons comics#Simpsons Comics|''Simpsons Comics'']], the 2007 video game ''[[The Simpsons Game]]'', and stars as the main antagonist in [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]] at Universal Studios' theme parks. A lover of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[operetta]]s, Sideshow Bob is also known for his singing voice; several of Grammer's performances have been included in [[The Simpsons discography|''The Simpsons'' musical compilations]].

==Appearances==

===On ''The Simpsons''===
The character of Sideshow Bob began his career as the non-speaking sidekick who would only use a 
whistle 
on [[Krusty the Clown]]'s television show.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Telltale Head |episode-link=The Telltale Head |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Reiss, Mike]]; [[Matt Groening|Groening, Matt]]; [[Sam Simon|Simon, Sam]]; [[Rich Moore|Moore, Rich]] |network=Fox |airdate=1990-02-25 |season=1 |number=8}}</ref> Bob first appears in "[[The Telltale Head]]" ([[The Simpsons season 1|season 1]], 1990). In the episode, he and Krusty plan a big event for whoever knows information of who captured the head of Jebediah Springfield's statue, and joins in on the town mob when it is  discovered that [[Bart Simpson]] took it. However, after repeated instances of abuse, including being [[Human cannonball|shot from a cannon]] and [[Pieing|hit constantly with pies]], the [[Yale]]-educated Bob became angry with Krusty and resentful of the clown's success.

In "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]" ([[The Simpsons season 1|season 1]], 1990), Bob disguised himself as Krusty and framed him for armed robbery of the [[Kwik-E-Mart]]. After Krusty is arrested, Bob takes control of the show, introducing children to elements of [[high culture]]. However, Bob's reign is short-lived; Bart exposes him as the robber, Krusty is released, and Bob is fired and sent to jail.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Krusty Gets Busted |episode-link=Krusty Gets Busted |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jay Kogen|Kogen, Jay]]; [[Wallace Wolodarsky|Wolodarsky, Wallace]]; [[Brad Bird|Bird, Brad]] |network=Fox |airdate=1990-04-29 |season=1 |number=12}}</ref>

In "[[Black Widower]]" ([[The Simpsons season 3|season 3]], 1992), Bob's first major appearance after framing Krusty, he is released from prison and marries Bart's aunt [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma Bouvier]] as part of a scheme to [[Inheritance|inherit]] money she has [[invested]] in the [[stock market]]. Bob attempts to blow Selma up during their [[honeymoon]], but Bart again foils the plan and Sideshow Bob returns to prison.<ref name="Black Widower">{{cite episode |title=Black Widower |episode-link=Black Widower |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jon Vitti|Vitti, Jon]]; [[David Silverman (animator)|Silverman, David]] |network=Fox |airdate=1992-04-09 |season=3 |number=56}}</ref>

After being [[parole]]d from prison in "[[Cape Feare]]" ([[The Simpsons season 5|season 5]], 1993), Bob targets Bart directly, threatening him repeatedly and forcing the Simpsons into hiding as part of the [[United States Federal Witness Protection Program|Witness Relocation Program]]. Bob follows them to their hideout, a [[houseboat]] on Terror Lake, and, after subduing the family, prepares to kill Bart. He allows a final request, however, and Bart asks to hear Bob sing the entire score of ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''. Although Bob finishes singing and nearly kills Bart, the delaying tactic leads to Bob's third arrest as the houseboat had drifted all the way back to Springfield.<ref name="Feare">{{cite episode |title=Cape Feare |episode-link=Cape Feare |series=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Moore, Rich |network=Fox |airdate=1993-10-07 |season=5 |number=83}}</ref>

Bob is released from prison once again in "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]" ([[The Simpsons season 6|season 6]], 1994), and runs for Mayor of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate (having previously identified himself as "a life-long Republican" in "Black Widower"). He defeats [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] incumbent [[Joe Quimby]] in a landslide, but Bart and Lisa discover from [[Waylon Smithers]]  that Bob [[Electoral fraud|rigged the election]] by using the names of deceased people. Bob is put on trial and claims himself innocent, but is tricked by Bart and Lisa to expose himself guilty, leading to another incarceration.<ref name="Roberts">{{cite episode |title=Sideshow Bob Roberts |episode-link=Sideshow Bob Roberts |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Oakley, Bill]]; [[Josh Weinstein|Weinstein, Josh]]; [[Kirkland, Mark]] |network=Fox |airdate=1994-10-09 |season=6 |number=108}}</ref>

Sideshow Bob escapes from prison for the first time in "[[Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming]]" ([[The Simpsons season 7|season 7]], 1995), and threatens to blow up Springfield with a [[nuclear bomb]] unless the city stops broadcasting all television shows. He is thwarted when he finds out that the bomb itself is a dud, then kidnaps Bart and flies the [[Wright Flyer|Wright Brothers' plane]] in an attempt to kill himself, Bart, and Krusty (who is hiding inside a shack, improvising a performance on the [[Emergency Broadcast System]]). This too is thwarted, and Bob returns to prison.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming |episode-link=Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Spike Feresten|Feresten, Spike]]; [[Dominic Polcino|Polcino, Dominic]] |network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-26 |season=7 |number=137}}</ref>

In the [[The Simpsons season 8|following season]], Bob takes advantage of the prison's [[work release program]], and appears to be genuinely redeemed. "[[Brother from Another Series]]" ([[The Simpsons season 8|season 8]], 1997) reveals that Bob only became Krusty's sidekick after his younger brother [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Cecil Terwilliger|Cecil]] failed an audition ten years prior, because Krusty considered Bob to be a perfect [[comic foil]].<ref name=bfas>{{cite episode |title=Brother from Another Series |episode-link=Brother from Another Series |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Ken Keeler|Keeler, Ken]]; [[Pete Michels|Michels, Pete]] |network=Fox |airdate=1997-02-23 |season=8 |number=169}}</ref> [[Reverend Lovejoy]] declares him a changed man and recommends him for a [[work release]] opportunity. Bob is discharged from prison into the care of Cecil, who is now [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s chief [[Hydraulic engineering|hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer]]. However, the scheming Cecil, still smarting over his failed audition for Krusty, tries to frame Bob by [[sabotaging]] the Springfield Dam by having it burst across Springfield. Bob, Bart, and Lisa together stop Cecil and save the town, and both brothers, despite Bob's genuine innocence, are sent to prison.<ref name=bfas/>

Bob returned in "[[Day of the Jackanapes]]" ([[The Simpsons season 12|season 12]], 2001), where he discovers in prison that Krusty has erased all of the early shows featuring Sideshow Bob as Krusty himself is declaring his fifth and final retirement after being annoyed with the [[Television producer|network executives]]. Bob is released from prison and develops a plot to kill Krusty using Bart as a [[suicide bomber]] during Krusty's retirement special. Everything goes just as Bob had planned, and just when Bob was about to succeed in murdering both his enemies, he overhears Krusty publicly holding himself responsible for turning Bob into a criminal, expressing his regret of mistreating Bob during his years as Sideshow. To appease things, Krusty sings himself a song on Bob's behalf, and being touched by this, Bob decides to abort his plan of [[attempted murder]] and reconciles with Krusty, although he is returned to prison for it.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Day of the Jackanapes |episode-link=Day of the Jackanapes |series=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; [[Marcantel, Michael]] |network=Fox |airdate=2001-02-18 |season=11 |number=261}}</ref>

Bob's aid is sought by Springfield police in "[[The Great Louse Detective]]" ([[The Simpsons season 14|season 14]], 2002). After an attempt is made on [[Homer Simpson]]'s life, Bob is released from prison to help find the culprit. During the adventure, Bob is given advice to kill Bart without hesitation, instead of being tricked into delay or screwing up on his plots. When the mystery is solved (it was [[Frank Grimes (The Simpsons)|Frank Grimes]]'s son), he returns to murder Bart. However, Bob finds he is "accustomed to his [Bart's] face" and cannot do it.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Great Louse Detective |episode-link=The Great Louse Detective |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Frink, John]]; [[Don Payne (writer)|Payne, Don]]; [[Moore, Steven Dean]] |network=Fox |airdate=2002-12-15 |season=14 |number=297}}</ref>

In "[[The Italian Bob]]" ([[The Simpsons season 17|season 17]], 2005), it is revealed that Bob had moved to [[Italy]] to make a fresh start. He was eventually elected mayor of the village of Salsiccia in [[Tuscany]] and marries a local woman named [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Francesca Terwilliger|Francesca]], with whom he has a son named [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Gino Terwilliger|Gino]]. The Simpson family, in Italy to retrieve a car for [[Mr. Burns]], encounters him by chance. Bob welcomes them with hospitality on the condition that they not reveal his dark felonious past; however, a drunken Lisa jokes about Bob's criminal deeds and reveals his prison uniform, alienating Bob from his citizens. Bob is angered enough to change his dream of killing Bart to killing the whole Simpson family. Upon catching up to Bob, his wife and his son swear a [[Feud|vendetta]] with him on all the Simpsons.<ref name="TIB">{{cite episode |title=The Italian Bob |episode-link=The Italian Bob |series=The Simpsons |credits=Frink, John; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=2005-12-11 |season=17 |number=364}}</ref>

The entire Terwilliger family returns in "[[Funeral for a Fiend]]" ([[The Simpsons season 19|season 19]], 2007) in which Bob's father, Robert Terwilliger Sr., and mother, Dame Judith Onderdonk, make their first appearances. [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Cecil Terwilliger|Cecil]] also appears a second time on the show. Bob at first attempts to kill the whole family a second time, but his plan fails. Bob fakes his own death during his trial and locks Bart in the [[coffin]], which he attempts to [[cremate]] at the otherwise empty [[funeral home]] as all the Terwilligers laugh maniacally. They are foiled by Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family and sent to prison.<ref name="FFAF">{{cite episode |title=Funeral for a Fiend |episode-link=Funeral for a Fiend |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Michael Price (writer)|Price, Michael]]; Oliver, Rob |network=Fox |airdate=2007-11-25 |season=19 |number=408}}</ref>

In "[[Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes]]" ([[The Simpsons season 20|season 20]], 2008), Bob is one of the wanted criminals in Homer and [[Ned Flanders]]'s bounty hunter job despite already being in prison, which he escapes from at the end of the episode. In "[[Wedding for Disaster]]" ([[The Simpsons season 20|season 20]], 2009), Bart and Lisa initially suspect Bob of kidnapping Homer to prevent him from attending his [[second wedding]] with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] (due to a keychain they found had an 'S' and a 'B'), but Krusty provides him with an alibi, explaining to the kids that Bob was with him the whole day. Eventually, Bob and the kids discover the true culprits, [[Patty and Selma]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&mo=3&d=22 |title=Primetime Listings (March 21&nbsp;– March 28) |access-date=March 7, 2009 |date=March 6, 2009 |publisher=FoxFlash |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313015253/http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&mo=3&d=22 |archive-date=March 13, 2009 }}</ref>
Bob also appears in "[[Coming to Homerica]]", the 21st episode of Season 20, in a joke where the Simpson family enters the Cheers bar dressed as the Cheers cast when Sideshow Bob comes in dressed as [[Frasier Crane]].

In "[[O Brother, Where Bart Thou?]]" ([[The Simpsons season 21|season 21]], 2009), Bob makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in Bart's dream sequence while the latter becomes desperate of having a younger brother. [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Cecil Terwilliger|Cecil]] makes his third appearance in ''The Simpsons'' by appearing alongside Bob; the brothers are flying kites together. Bob reappears again in the episode "[[The Bob Next Door]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 21)|season 21]], 2010). He switches faces with his prison cellmate Walt Warren. Bob returns to Springfield and moves into the house next to the Simpson family, assuming Walt's identity. He exploits this to make his latest attempt to kill Bart legally over state lines, but is foiled again and gets taken away by [[State police (United States)|state police]].<ref name="TBND">{{cite episode |title=The Bob Next Door |episode-link=The Bob Next Door |series=The Simpsons |credits=Frink, John; [[Nancy Kruse|Kruse, Nancy]] |network=Fox |airdate=2010-05-16 |season=21 |number=463}}</ref>

In "[[The Man Who Grew Too Much]]" ([[The Simpsons season 25|season 25]], 2014), he was revealed to be a Chief Scientist for a [[genetic engineering]] company named [[Monsanto|Monsarno]], having received the position after he was selected as a [[test subject]] and published the results of the experiments to which he was subjected. He and Lisa bond over their interest in [[Walt Whitman]], but Bob reveals that he has also genetically modified himself to give himself various [[superhuman]] abilities, intending to acquire [[DNA]] from the relics of various [[historical figure]]s stored in the Springfield Museum to make himself a superhuman [[dictator]]. After tempted into a murderous rage, he chases down Bart and Lisa and is about to kill them but however, he is provoked into a fight and he realizes that he has become a crude monster and jumps off the Springfield Dam. The episode ends with Bob underwater in the lake, shown to have survived because the [[gill]]s he gave himself allow him to live.

Bob also appears in "[[Clown in the Dumps]]" ([[The Simpsons season 26|season 26]], 2014). Having returned to prison, he offered his condolences to Krusty following  the death of his father, [[Rabbi Krustofsky]]. Several episodes later, Bob returned in "[[Blazed and Confused]]" ([[The Simpsons season 26|season 26]], 2014), where he meets Mr. Lassen, Bart's former teacher, who was now reduced to working in prison as a [[Prison officer|guard]] after Bart's earlier actions at a "Blazing Guy" festival got him fired. Despite Lassen's offer to get him out, Bob rejects the idea that they team up as Lassen thought that they would take turns gutting Bart.

In "[[Treehouse of Horror XXVI]]" ([[The Simpsons season 27|season 27]], 2015), in the first segment called "Wanted: Dead, then Alive", Bob uses [[Milhouse]]'s phone to trap Bart in the band classroom and successfully kills him. In peace with himself, Bob moves on from Bart to pursue other dreams, however, due to Bob chasing down Bart for so long, Bob finds his life so meaningless in Bart's absence that he creates a machine to bring Bart back to life so that he can keep killing his enemy over and over, until the other Simpsons find Bob's location and rescue Bart,  and Bart uses the resurrection machine to turn Bob into a twisted amalgamation of creatures. Bob also appears in the episode "[[Gal of Constant Sorrow]]" ([[The Simpsons season 17|season 27]], 2016), grunting in annoyance as he wipes off Bart's [[graffiti]] from Hettie Mae Boggs' promo poster on the wall along with [[Snake Jailbird]] and other inmates.

Bob returns in "[[Treehouse of Horror XXVII]]" ([[The Simpsons season 28|season 28]], 2016), the 600th episode of ''The Simpsons''. In the opening sequence, he is the self-appointed leader of a four-member group consisting of Homer's enemies, including Bob himself and the ghost of Frank Grimes. Wanting revenge once more, the group attempts to kill the Simpsons but is ultimately killed by [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], except Grimes's ghost. In the ending sequence, Bob is one of the characters featured in the "600" song played by [[Judith Owen]]. In "[[Havana Wild Weekend]]" ([[The Simpsons season 28|season 28]], 2016), Sideshow Bob appeared in the backgrounds at the Cuba's check-in.

Bob also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in "[[The Nightmare After Krustmas]]" ([[The Simpsons season 28|season 28]], 2016); he is amongst the crowd witnessing Krusty nearly drowning in a frozen lake while holding up a sign saying "Die Clown". He's had a major appearance in "[[Gone Boy]]" ([[The Simpsons season 29|season 29]], 2017), when he tries to track down the whereabouts of Bart after he goes missing and is presumed dead. Bob finds Bart and proceeds to kill him and [[Milhouse]], but saves them at the last minute due to the influence of the prison therapist's lessons of potentially moving on from wanting to kill Bart. The epilogue features an older Bob, now known as Elder Bob, being a lighthouse keeper and still having regrets of not killing Bart.

In "[[The Fat Blue Line]]" ([[The Simpsons season 31|season 31]], 2019), Bob escapes from prison once again, only to be hit by a rake truck. Several episodes later, in "[[Bobby, It's Cold Outside]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 31)|season 31]], 2019), he is hired to play Santa Claus at a theme park, and later helps the Simpsons discover who is stealing everyone's Christmas gifts. Bob returned in a non-speaking cameo in "[[Meat Is Murder (The Simpsons)|Meat Is Murder]]" ([[The Simpsons season 33|season 33]], 2022), where he is seen signing the chests of citizens like Milhouse's father [[Kirk Van Houten]] at the celebration of [[Krusty the Clown|Krusty Burger]]'s 50th anniversary, a callback to the "Die Bart, Die" scene from "Cape Feare".

In the "[[Treehouse of Horror XXXIV]]" segment "Ei8ht" ([[The Simpsons season 35|season 35]], 2023), in an alternative ending to "Cape Feare", Bob realizes that Bart is stalling his death by making him sing ''Pinafore'', and as a result, kills him, traumatizing Lisa. 30 years later, the Springfield Police asks Professor Lisa Simpson to look into a series of murders committed by an unknown serial killer. Perplexed, Lisa seeks Bob's help, but Bob just mocks Lisa. Later, Lisa realizes she herself has done all the murders. Bob is transferred to another prison cell to find Lisa waiting for her, revealing that a split personality emerged after the death of Bart and that she had committed all those murders in hopes of going to prison with Bob. To the music of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', Lisa gleefully slashes Bob to death.

In Season 36’s "[[The Yellow Lotus]]", Bob has a minor role, as he is shown to be married and in the same resort with the Simpsons. When Marge tells Bob's wife about his previous deeds, she throws him off of a cliff, only for Bob to survive and talk with Sideshow Mel.

===Other media===
In addition to regular roles in the television series, Sideshow Bob has made several appearances in other ''Simpsons'' media.

In ''[[The Simpsons: Tapped Out]]'', a [[city-building game]] released in February 2012, Sideshow Bob occurs as a bonus. Popping up every couple hours, the players are given a chance to tap on him to receive a small sum of money, and "send" him to jail. In a later update to the game, Sideshow Bob also has a stand in Krusty Land, where players get to pop balloons for a chance to win donuts and Krusty [[Ticket (admission)|tickets]]. The Simpsons: Tapped Out Terwilligers content update was released April 14, 2015 and has several references to the Simpsons episodes with Sideshow Bob. This game event was split in 3 acts and ended June 4, 2015. New characters, skins and costumes include Sideshow Bob, Cecil Terwilliger, Gino Terwilliger, Francesca Terwilliger, Dr. Robert Terwilliger Sr., Judith Onderdonk, Captain Bob, and Opera Krusty. Most of the event action takes place at Monsarno Research and Opera House.

==Character==

===Creation===
[[File:SideshowBobsfirstappearance.png|right|200px|thumb|Sideshow Bob in his first appearance in "The Telltale Head". His design was simple compared to later versions and would be refined for his appearance in "Krusty Gets Busted".]]
Sideshow Bob first appeared in "[[The Telltale Head]]", the eighth episode of [[The Simpsons (season 1)|season 1]]. His design was relatively simple compared to later incarnations, and his hairstyle was rounded. However, towards the end of the episode, he appears again, in a panning shot of a crowd, with his familiar hairstyle.<ref name="MooreTTH"/> His second appearance, and first major one, was in season 1's twelfth episode "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]", written by [[Jay Kogen]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]].{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=28–29}} Bob's design was updated for "Krusty Gets Busted"; as the episode's animation style evolved, director [[Brad Bird]] made the character of Sideshow Bob sleeker and more refined, to fit Grammer's voice technique.<ref name="SilvermanBW"/> Following the re-design, animators tried to redraw his scenes in "The Telltale Head", but had insufficient time before the show was produced.<ref name="MooreTTH">Moore, Rich. (2001). Commentary for "The Telltale Head", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

Bob has no lines of dialogue during the first half of "Krusty Gets Busted"; the character's only communication takes the form of a [[slide whistle]]. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would be surprised to hear his sophisticated vocabulary.<ref name="JeanKGB">Jean, Al. (2001). Commentary for "Krusty Gets Busted", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> An early version of the script for "Krusty Gets Busted" called for [[James Earl Jones]] to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected [[Kelsey Grammer]].<ref name="BirdKGB">Bird, Brad.

===Development===
For [[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]]'s "[[Black Widower]]", the writers echoed the premise of [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons by having Bob unexpectedly insert himself into Bart's life and attempt to kill him. Executive producer [[Al Jean]] has compared Bob's character to that of Wile E. Coyote, noting that both are intelligent, yet always foiled by what they perceive as an inferior intellect.<ref name="JeanBW">Jean, Al. (2003).

(2006). Commentary for "Brother From Another Series", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Another rule established by the show's writers mandated Bob's return to prison at the end of each episode, although this pattern was abandoned in later episodes like "The Great Louse Detective" and "The Italian Bob".<ref name="Weinstein"/>
[[File:Kelsey Grammer - Cropped.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kelsey Grammer]] based Bob's voice on his experiences with actor [[Ellis Rabb]]. |alt=A man wearing a cap smiles broadly.]]
[[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], the [[showrunner]]s for the seventh and eighth seasons, believed that every season of the show should contain an episode starring Sideshow Bob. However, by the seventh season, Bob had already been the focus of four episodes, and writers were having trouble developing new ways to include him.<ref>Oakley, Bill. (2005). Commentary for "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Weinstein describes Bob's dialogue as difficult to write, due to his unique and refined style of speaking.<ref>Weinstein, Josh. (2005). Commentary for "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Despite these challenges, however, creators of ''The Simpsons'' usually look forward to "Sideshow Bob episodes"; the writers consider them enjoyable to write,<ref name="Keeler">Keeler, Ken.

(2005). Commentary for "Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

Kelsey Grammer initially expected Sideshow Bob to be a one-time role, and calls him "the most popular character I've ever played".<ref name="Grammer"/> Grammer usually joins the show's "table readings" (wherein cast members read each script together for the first time),<ref name="JeanCF">Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for "Cape Feare", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> and former executive producer [[David Mirkin]] described working with Grammer as very pleasant, due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh.<ref name="Mirkin">Mirkin, David. (2005). Commentary for "Sideshow Bob Roberts", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> In a 2007 interview, ''Simpsons'' executive producer [[Al Jean]] listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to [[Phil Hartman]]), saying "his voice is so rich."<ref name="Star">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/05/20/producer_speaks_out_on_cartoon_cameos.html |title=Producer speaks out on cartoon cameos |work=[[Toronto Star]] |access-date=October 13, 2007 |date=May 20, 2007}}</ref> Writer [[George Meyer]] commented that "writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give.

The show's writers admire Grammer's singing voice, and try to include a song for each appearance.<ref name="JeanCF"/> [[Alf Clausen]], the primary composer for ''The Simpsons'', commented that "[Grammer] is so great. He's just amazing. You can tell he has this love of musical theater and he has the vocal instrument to go with it, so I know whatever I write is going to be sung the way I've heard it."<ref>{{Cite news |title=The man who makes 'The Simpsons' sing |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/20/simpsons.clausen/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |author=Leopold, Todd |date=September 21, 2007 |access-date=January 3, 2009}}</ref> Clausen composed Sideshow Bob's theme, which is played whenever Bob gets out of prison or is about to commit a sinister action, and was first used in "[[Cape Feare]]". It is based on the score of the film ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]'', composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]].<ref name="JeanCF"/> The musical score for "Cape Feare" earned Clausen an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series|Outstanding Dramatic Underscore – Series]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |title=Primetime Emmy Awards Advanced Search |publisher=Emmys.org |access-date=October 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403022947/http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |archive-date=April 3, 2009 }}</ref>

Bob's prisoner number is often 24601, which is [[Jean Valjean]]'s prisoner number in ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]''.<ref name="Reiss">Reiss, Mike. (2003). Commentary for "Black Widower", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Another trademark for Bob is a visual gag of stepping on a rake and being struck in the face with its handle; this joke first appeared in "Cape Feare". To fill time, the writers added nine consecutive iterations of the same joke in quick succession.<ref name="JeanCF"/> The sequence has become known as the "rake joke" and was described by ''Entertainment Weekly'' as showing "genius in its repetitive stupidity."<ref name="EW"/>

===Family===
[[File:David Hyde Pierce - Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sideshow Bob's brother Cecil was designed to resemble actor [[David Hyde Pierce]], who also played the brother of Grammer's character on the show ''Frasier''.]]
The episode "[[Brother from Another Series]]" introduces Bob's brother Cecil. After writer [[Ken Keeler]] was assigned to write an episode featuring Sideshow Bob, he drew inspiration from episodes of ''[[Frasier]]''. He decided to incorporate elements of Grammer's other show into the character of Sideshow Bob, and designed Cecil to resemble Grammer's brother on ''Frasier''.<ref name="Keeler"/> Cecil is voiced by [[David Hyde Pierce]], who portrayed [[Frasier Crane]]'s brother [[Niles Crane|Niles]]. Pierce commented, "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do you get a chance to work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?"<ref>{{Cite news |title=TV Tidbits |work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]] |date=February 20, 1997}}</ref> Several of ''Frasier''{{'s}} producers were asked to review the original script and provide feedback. Their comments were positive; they only expressed concern with a very brief scene in which Cecil talks to a visible character whom he refers to as "Maris". In ''Frasier'', [[Maris Crane]] is an [[unseen character]], and the producers of ''Frasier'' asked that the scene be removed.<ref name="Keeler"/> Many of the interactions between Bob and Cecil were based on those of Niles and Frasier.<ref name="Keeler"/> Cecil was drawn to resemble [[David Hyde Pierce]], while retaining a visual similarity to Sideshow Bob. According to director [[Pete Michels]], it was difficult to draw Bob and Cecil standing together, because of their comically oversized feet.<ref name="Michels">Michels, Pete. (2006). Commentary for "Brother From Another Series", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

Cecil returns in [[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]]'s "[[Funeral for a Fiend]]", which introduces the brothers' previously unseen father, Dr. Robert Terwilliger, played by [[John Mahoney]].<ref name="Futon">{{cite magazine |title=The Simpsons |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=September 4, 2007 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20054579,00.html |access-date=January 1, 2009 |archive-date=February 4, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204020429/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20054579,00.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mahoney portrayed [[Martin Crane]], the father of Grammer's and Pierce's characters in ''Frasier''.<ref name=Frasierreunion>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a75660/frasier-cast-to-reunite-for-simpsons.html |title=''Frasier'' cast to reunite for ''Simpsons'' |date=September 14, 2007 |author=Dadds, Kimberley |access-date=October 15, 2007 |work=Digital Spy}}</ref> Whereas in ''Frasier'', Mahoney played the "down-to-Earth, average guy" to Grammer's and Hyde Pierce's "uppity snobs", Robert Terwilliger Sr. was portrayed as equally highbrow as Bob.<ref>{{cite web |author=Canning, Robert |title=The Simpsons: "Funeral for a Fiend" Review |website=IGN |date=November 26, 2007 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/837/837504p1.html |access-date=January 3, 2009}}</ref> His wife, Bob's mother, is Dame Judith Onderdonk, "the finest classical actress of her generation."

The character of Sideshow Bob and Grammer's voicework have received many accolades. In 2006, [[IGN]] listed him as the second-best "peripheral character" on ''The Simpsons'', commenting that Bob is "a man of contradictions; his goofy appearance, complete with palm tree like hair, doesn't seem to match up to the well spoken and even musically talented maniac."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p5.html |title=Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters |access-date=June 8, 2007 |date=September 6, 2006 |author1=Eric Goldman |author2=Dan Iverson |author3=Brian Zoromski |website=[[IGN]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031112102/http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p5.html |archive-date=October 31, 2007 }}</ref> Also that year, ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine rated Bob as the 66th-greatest villain of all time.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McCallum |first=Pat |date=July 2006 |title=100 Greatest Villains Ever |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |issue=177}}</ref> Adam Finley of [[TV Squad]] wrote that "that baritone voice, the Shakespearean delivery, and the ability to go from calm and collected to stark raving mad all within the same second make Sideshow Bob one of the best recurring characters on the show."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/20/the-five-great-simpsons-guest-stars/ |title=The Five: Great Simpsons guest stars |author=Finley, Adam |publisher=TV Squad |date=June 20, 2006 |access-date=January 3, 2009}}</ref>

The first five Bob episodes took up the top five, with "Cape Feare" being ranked first. "The Italian Bob" was ranked tenth, with the explanation that "All the things we love about a Sideshow Bob episode—the vengeance, the familiar settings and characters, the elaborate scheming—were missing from this half-hour. Without it, Bob wasn't nearly as entertaining, and the episode didn't result in a whole lot of laughs." He noted that only "The Italian Bob" and the ninth ranked "Funeral for a Fiend" were "the only ones I'd consider clunkers. The remaining episodes are all quite fun."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/105/1051182p1.html |author=Canning, Robert |date=December 2, 2009 |website=IGN |access-date=May 19, 2010 |title=The Simpsons: Top 10 Sideshow Bob Episodes}}</ref>

The character's line in "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]", "Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel prize for attempted chemistry?", briefly became an [[Internet meme]] after a similar defense of President [[Donald Trump]] was repeated after the [[Trump–Ukraine scandal]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/14/one-defenses-trump-is-literally-tv-sitcom-joke/ | title=One of the defenses of Trump is — literally — a TV-cartoon joke | first=Bill | last=Oakley | date=2019-11-14 | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

===Analysis===
In ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', author [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] writes that Bob is built into a highbrow snob and conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents [[high culture]] while Krusty represents [[low culture]], and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=129–131}} In the book ''[[Leaving Springfield]]'', David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart is a product of a "mass-culture upbringing" and thus is Bob's enemy.<ref>[[#Arnold|Arnold]], pp. 2–3.</ref> Frustrated by his early role as the target of "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives.<ref name="p12"/> Arnold writes that "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." He also tries to "manipulate the tastes of the masses" by becoming a criminal mastermind.<ref name="p12">[[#Arnold|Arnold]], pp. 12–13.</ref> Arnold believes that this is most apparent in "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, "Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who'll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! That's why I did this, to protect you from yourselves!" He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses [[Machiavelli]]an methods to acquire and maintain power.<ref>[[#Arnold|Arnold]], p. 17.</ref>

Bob's intelligence serves him in many ways. During the episode "Cape Feare", for example, the parole board asks Bob why he has a tattoo that says "Die, Bart, Die". Bob replies that it is German for "The, Bart, The"; members of the board are impressed by his reasoning.<ref name=A16/> Believing that "nobody who speaks German could be an evil man", they release him.<ref name="Feare"/> However, his love of high culture is sometimes used against him. In the same episode, Bob agrees to perform the operetta ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in its entirety as a last request for Bart. The tactic stalls Bob long enough for the police to arrest him.<ref name=A16>[[#Arnold|Arnold]], p. 16.</ref>
