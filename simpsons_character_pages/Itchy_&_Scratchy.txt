'''''The Itchy & Scratchy Show''''' (often shortened as '''''Itchy & Scratchy''''') is a [[Story within a story|fictional animated series]] featured on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. The cartoon depicts an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[mouse]] named Itchy who repeatedly [[Mutilation|maims]] or [[Murder|murders]] an anthropomorphic [[black cat]] named Scratchy. It is typically presented as 15- to 60-second [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] that are a part of ''The [[Krusty the Clown]] Show''. ''Itchy & Scratchy'' is filled with graphic violence, [[Television content rating system|unsuitable for children]], that almost invariably prompts laughter from ''The Simpsons'' characters, especially [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]].

The Itchy and Scratchy characters are extremely violent and bloody parodies of [[cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse]] cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]],'' ''[[Herman and Katnip]]'', ''Kit 'n' Kaboodle'', and ''[[Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks]]''. The Italian comic strip ''[[Squeak the Mouse]]'' is also considered to be an inspiration for the characters.<ref name="Sergio Algozzino 112–113">{{cite book |last=Sergio Algozzino |title=Tutt'a un tratto.

The cartoon first appeared in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "The Bart Simpson Show", which aired in 1988. The cartoon's first appearance in ''The Simpsons'' was in the 1990 episode "[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]". The cartoons became popular among the show's writers and animators, and they are often added when an episode needs expanding. Several full episodes were centered on the fictional production of ''Itchy & Scratchy'', such as "[[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]]".

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' is a [[story within a story|show within a show]] that appears occasionally in episodes of ''The Simpsons''. They appear in the form of 15- to 60-second-long cartoons that are filled with graphic violence, almost always initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat, with the former almost always being the victor.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=33-34}} ''Itchy & Scratchy'' airs as a segment on ''The [[Krusty the Clown]] Show'', and also aired on its brief replacements, ''[[Sideshow Bob]]'s Cavalcade of Whimsy'', and ''[[Krusty Gets Kancelled|Gabbo]]''.<ref name="KGK">{{cite episode |title=Krusty Gets Kancelled |episode-link=Krusty Gets Kancelled |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-13 |season=04 |number=22}}</ref> ''Itchy & Scratchy'' mostly airs as a standalone show rather than being a segment in some episodes, such as "[[In Marge We Trust]]" ([[The Simpsons season 8|season 8]], 1997).

''Itchy & Scratchy'' is usually a parody of traditional cartoons or takeoffs on famous films, but the plot and content are always violent and bloody, with Itchy performing unprovoked acts of graphic violence and homicide unlike most classic cartoons. The most direct and obvious example is ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', an animated series which was also about a constant battle between a cat and a mouse, with the mouse usually victorious, though in ''Itchy & Scratchy'', the mouse acts as the antagonist. ''Itchy & Scratchy'' also includes shorts such as ''Scratchtasia'', a parody of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', and ''Pinitchio'', a parody of ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.<ref name="Groening2">{{cite AV media |people=Groening, Matt |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Animation-related jokes are prevalent in the show, such as the ''Manhattan Madness'' cartoon in "[[The Day the Violence Died]]", which is based on very early animated cartoons such as ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]''.<ref name="TDTVD"/> The cartoons also occasionally serve to play out an exaggerated form of the conflict in the surrounding episode. For example, in "[[Deep Space Homer]]" ([[The Simpsons season 5|season five]], 1994), Homer is recruited by [[NASA]], and later watches an ''Itchy & Scratchy'' cartoon which directly (and gruesomely) parodies the films ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''.<ref>{{cite video |people=Mirkin, David |date=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 5 commentary for the episode "Deep Space Homer" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Fictional production history===
Several full episodes of ''The Simpsons'' were centered on the fictional production history of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show''. It begins with Chester J. Lampwick creating Itchy the mouse for the now-[[lost film|lost]] [[silent film|silent]] cartoon ''Manhattan Madness'', in which Itchy brutally attacks and kills an [[Irish people|Irishman]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], in 1919 (the year of the first ''[[Felix the Cat]]'' cartoon). However, the character was later stolen by Roger Meyers.<ref name="Violence">{{cite episode |title=The Day the Violence Died |episode-link=The Day the Violence Died |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=1996-03-17 |season=07 |number=18}}</ref> Scratchy starred in his first cartoon in 1928 titled ''That Happy Cat''. The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, was a commercial failure. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together called ''Steamboat Itchy'', a violent parody of [[Disney]]'s ''[[Steamboat Willie]]''.<ref name="The Movie">{{cite episode |title=Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie |episode-link=Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Moore, Rich |network=Fox |airdate=1992-11-03 |season=04 |number=06}}</ref> Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a [[World War II]]–era radio series,<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Old Man and the Key |episode-link=The Old Man and the Key |series=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Kramer, Lance |network=Fox |airdate=2002-03-10 |season=13 |number=13}}</ref> at least two films (''Pinitchio'' and ''Scratchtasia,'' which are parodies of ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', respectively),<ref name="Land">{{cite episode |title=Itchy & Scratchy Land |episode-link=Itchy & Scratchy Land |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=1994-10-02 |season=06 |number=04}}</ref> and television commercials for Laramie Cigarettes.<ref>{{cite episode |title=HOMR |episode-link=HOMR |series=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; [[Mike B.

Itchy & Scratchy Studios is run by Roger Meyers Jr., the son of Roger Meyers, the cartoon's supposed creator. The studio was [[bankruptcy|bankrupted]] after it was sued by Lampwick for $800 million when he was represented by [[Lionel Hutz]], but was saved after receiving a large cash settlement from the government over its use of [[Mr. ZIP]].<ref name="Violence"/> The show underwent a brief, non-violent retooling following a protest campaign led by [[Marge Simpson]], but it returned to its original violent format after Marge was later discredited after defending the display of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' in Springfield in the face of public objection.<ref name="And Marge">{{cite episode |title=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |episode-link=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1990-12-20 |season=02 |number=09}}</ref> ''Itchy & Scratchy'' has spawned an [[fictional universe|in-universe]] [[Academy Award]]–winning film adaptation,<ref name="The Movie"/> amusement parks,<ref name="Land"/> and a musical;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Girls Just Want to Have Sums |episode-link=Girls Just Want to Have Sums |series=The Simpsons |credits=Selman, Matt; Kruse, Nancy |network=Fox |airdate=2006-04-30 |season=17 |number=19}}</ref> and, like Krusty's show, localized versions are produced for other countries, such as Jamaica's ''The Itchem and Scratchem Blow''.<ref name="YS">{{cite episode |title=Yellow Subterfuge |episode-link=Yellow Subterfuge |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, Joel H; Anderson, Bob |network=Fox |airdate=2013-12-08 |season=25 |number=07}}</ref>

==Characters==
===Featured in ''Itchy & Scratchy''===
* '''Itchy''' (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]) is a [[blue]] [[mouse]] and the show's [[Villain|villainous]] antagonist; he almost always succeeds in his relentless attempts in mutilating or [[Murder|killing]] Scratchy and any other cats around. Itchy is rarely given any motivation for these attacks outside of the thrill of killing, often [[Evil laughter|laughing in an evil fashion]] whilst murdering other characters.
* '''Scratchy''' (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]), the protagonist, is a threadbare, dim-witted [[black cat]] and the perpetual victim of Itchy's violent acts; as opposed to [[Tom Cat|Tom]] of ''Tom and Jerry'', Scratchy seldom antagonizes the mouse to provoke him in any way and is almost always an ordinary [[civilian]] going about an [[everyday life]] until Itchy kills him.
* '''Poochie''' (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] when voiced by Homer Simpson, [[Alex Rocco]] when voiced by Roger Meyers, Jr.), is an orange dog that appeared in "[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]" ([[The Simpsons season 8|season eight]], 1997). In the episode, the producers of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' believed the cartoons were getting stale, and needed a new character to reinvigorate the show. [[Homer Simpson]] gets the job of voicing Poochie, who is introduced in the cartoon, "The Beagle Has Landed". A product of marketing department thinking, Poochie was near-universally despised due to interfering with the graphic violence, and was permanently killed off in his second appearance, despite Homer's objections. The episode was both a reference to TV shows which added new characters purportedly to reinvigorate the show, and a commentary on the growing complaints of fans of ''The Simpsons''. The original idea for the episode was that Poochie would be obnoxious because he was so rich, rather than because he was so cool.<ref name="TISPS"/> Poochie would later make brief speaking cameo appearances in "[[Treehouse of Horror IX]]", "[[Little Big Mom]]", and "[[The Nightmare After Krustmas]]".<ref name="TISPS"/><ref>{{cite episode |title=Little Big Mom |episode-link=Little Big Mom |series=The Simpsons |credits=Omine, Carolyn; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=2000-01-14 |season=09 |number=10}}</ref>

===Production staff===
* '''Roger Meyers Jr.''' (voiced by [[Alex Rocco]] in 1990, 1996–1997, [[Hank Azaria]] in 1993–1994) is the Chairman of the Board of Itchy & Scratchy Studios and son of Roger Meyers.<ref name="And Marge"/> He first appeared in "[[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]]" ([[The Simpsons season 2|season two]], 1990). He distributes the cartoon and is a jaded and selfish businessman who has nothing but contempt for his audience.<ref name="Poochie">{{cite episode |title=The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show |episode-link=The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show |series=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David S.; Moore, Steven Dean |network=Fox |airdate=1997-02-09 |season=08 |number=14}}</ref> He has an extremely callous personality; he only cares about people who can help him. This is displayed in his contempt for the writers of ''The Itchy & Scratchy Show''.<ref name="Front"/> Alex Rocco also voiced Meyers in "The Day the Violence Died" and "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show".

At first he tried doing a special voice, but was told to "just be yourself."<ref name="Rocco"/> Rocco was one of Bill Oakley's and Josh Weinstein's favorite guest stars, and they liked including him in their episodes so they could "have a little fun with him."<ref name="TDTVD"/> On occasions when Rocco was unavailable to do a voice over, Meyers was voiced by [[Hank Azaria]] in "[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]" ([[The Simpsons season 4|season four]], 1993), "[[Lady Bouvier's Lover]]" ([[The Simpsons season 5|season five]], 1994) and "[[Itchy & Scratchy Land]]" ([[The Simpsons season 6|season six]], 1994).<ref name="TF"/> The spelling of Meyers' name has been inconsistent in the show. His last name was spelled both Myers and Meyers in "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge", and Myers the later episode "The Day the Violence Died".<ref name="Violence"/><ref name="And Marge"/> His name is spelled Meyers in "The Front", as well as in the book ''[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]]''.<ref name="Front">{{cite episode |title=The Front |episode-link=The Front (The Simpsons) |series=The Simpsons |credits=Lapidus, Adam I.; Moore, Rich |network=Fox |airdate=1993-04-15 |season=04 |number=19}}</ref>{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=43}}
* '''Roger Meyers Sr.''' first appeared in video footage in "Itchy & Scratchy Land" and has never had a speaking role. He was created because the writers felt it would have been "tortured logic" to have the Roger Meyers Jr. be the creator.<ref name="TDTVD"/> Roger Meyers Sr. has similarities to [[Walt Disney]].<ref name="ISL"/> For example, Disney's alleged [[antisemitism]] is spoofed when it is revealed that Meyers made a cartoon called ''Nazi Supermen are Our Superiors''.<ref name=EW>{{cite magazine |title=The Family Dynamic |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2003-01-29 |access-date=2008-12-12 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_2,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510032159/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C417748_2%2C00.html |archive-date=2007-05-10}}</ref>
* '''June Bellamy''' (voiced by [[Tress MacNeille]] in her normal voice, Dan Castellaneta in her Itchy voice, Harry Shearer in her Scratchy voice, [[Julie Kavner]] in her Disapproving Squirrel voice) is the actress who portrays both Itchy and Scratchy. Her only appearance was in "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show". She is presumably a reference to veteran voice actress [[June Foray]], who also voiced several male characters, notably [[Rocky the Flying Squirrel]]. In actuality, Itchy and Scratchy are voiced by two different men rather than one woman.<ref name="TISPS"/>
* '''Chester J. Lampwick''' (voiced by [[Kirk Douglas]]) is the creator of Itchy and only appeared in "The Day the Violence Died". The producers' first choice for the character, [[William Hickey (actor)|William Hickey]], declined.<ref name="TDTVD"/> Douglas's recording session was fraught with interruptions because he refused to wear the supplied earphones and said the maximum he would do was two takes.<ref>{{cite book |title=My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy |last=Cartwright |first=Nancy |author-link=Nancy Cartwright |chapter=Spartacus! |pages=[https://archive.org/details/mylifeastenyearo00nanc/page/222 222–228] |year=2000 |publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher) |Hyperion]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-7868-8600-5 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeastenyearo00nanc/page/222}}</ref>
* In several episodes revolving around the production of ''Itchy & Scratchy'', caricatures of ''The Simpsons''<nowiki/>' staff are used as the '''writing staff''' of ''Itchy & Scratchy''.

''The Itchy & Scratchy Show'' first appeared in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "The Bart Simpson Show", which originally aired on November 20, 1988. They were the first major recurring characters outside of the Simpson family to appear.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=14-15}} As a child, series creator [[Matt Groening]] and his friends would fantasize about an ultra-violent cartoon and how much fun it would be to work on a show like that.<ref name="tvguide">{{cite magazine |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |date=2000-10-21 |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |first=Joe |last=Rhodes}}</ref><ref name="Groening1">{{cite AV media |people=Groening, Matt |date=2002 |title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Itchy & Scratchy & Marge" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The names "Itchy" and "Scratchy" were inspired by Pixie and Dixie, which was a segment on the cartoon show ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]''.<ref name="Groening1"/> The comic strip ''[[Squeak the Mouse]]'' is also considered an apparent inspiration for the characters.<ref name="Sergio Algozzino 112–113"/><ref name="Comics Journal Incorporated 2007, p.27"/><ref name="Giuseppe Pollicelli 2011"/><ref name="Costanza Ognibeni"/> As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', and it was one of the reasons to why he got into cartooning.<ref name="Greyhound"/> In the film, the puppies watch television, and the idea of having a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening.

David Silverman states that Itchy and Scratchy cartoons are "an ironic commentary on cartoon mayhem in the sense that it's taken to a more realistic level. The kids on ''The Simpsons'' are laughing at it, and we're laughing too, but part of what you're laughing at is the over-the-top excessiveness of the violence."<ref name="silverman">{{cite web |title=The David Silverman Interview |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |author=Heintjes, Tom |year=2004 |url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp |access-date=2008-12-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023004901/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp |archive-date=2008-10-23}}</ref>

The ''Itchy and Scratchy show'' first appeared in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "The Bart Simpson Show", which aired on November 20, 1988; the performance style at the time was like ''Tom and Jerry'' and, unusually, featured Scratchy much like his [[Tom Cat|Tom and Jerry counterpart]], attacking Itchy. Their first appearance in ''The Simpsons'' was "[[There's No Disgrace Like Home]]".<ref name="tvguide"/> In the series, it was quickly established early on that Scratchy was a [[Pacifism|peaceful]] character that was persecuted by his friend, the [[Psychopathy|Psychopathic]] mouse, Itchy.

During David Mirkin's tenure as showrunner ([[The Simpsons season 5|season five]] and [[The Simpsons season 6|six]]), he was asked by the [[Fox network]] not to do any more Itchy & Scratchy cartoons due to the amount of violence in them. In response, the show produced "[[Itchy & Scratchy Land]]". The network asked them not to do the episode, and threatened that if the episode was produced, they would cut the Itchy & Scratchy parts out themselves, but relented when Mirkin threatened to tell the media. The writers nevertheless promised to try not to overdo the violence and in some scenes the violence was cut.<ref name="ISL">Mirkin, David.

During their tenure as executive producers, [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] tried to fit in one episode relating to ''Itchy & Scratchy'' every season.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
In his 2004 book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', author [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] describes ''Itchy & Scratchy'' as "by far the most gleeful visual [[MSTing|riffing]] on ''The Simpsons'' [...] each snippet of "Itchy & Scratchy" packs as much frenetically paced action, sight-gaggery, and physical humor into its half-minute of screen time as a half-dozen [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]] cartoons and a dozen ''[[Tom & Jerry]]s''."{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=33-34}}

In 2007, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' named "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" the sixth-best episode in the show's history, describing it as "a classic satire of network influence, obsessed TV fans, and programs that survive long after [[jumping the shark|the shark has been jumped]], the episode is a meta-celebration, a tongue-in-cheek rebuttal to everyone who claimed that the quality of ''The Simpsons'' had declined over the years."<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Springfield's Best |last=Orvted |first=John |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=2007-09-22 |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2007/08/top10simpsons200708 |access-date=2007-07-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530090021/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/top10simpsons200708 |archive-date=2009-05-30}}</ref>
