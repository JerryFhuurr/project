'''Dr. Julius Michael Hibbert, M.D.'''<ref>{{cite episode |title=My Sister, My Sitter |episode-link=My Sister, My Sitter |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=Fox |airdate=1997-03-03 |season=8 |number=17 |time=16:05}}</ref>{{Sfn|Groening|2010|pp=1105, 1155}} is a recurring character on the television animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is Springfield's most prominent medical professional. Although he has a kind and warm persona, he is also often characterized as greedy and lacking in empathy. His signature character trait is his often-inappropriate chuckling, which is generally cued by misfortune rather than something genuinely amusing. 

A parody of [[Bill Cosby]]'s character [[Cliff Huxtable|Dr. Cliff Huxtable]], the character debuted on December 6, 1990, in the episode [[Bart the Daredevil]].{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=68}} He was voiced from his debut by ''Simpsons'' regular [[Harry Shearer]], and since a [[List of changes made due to the George Floyd protests|recasting of all of the show's non-white characters]], by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] from 2021.<ref name="kmr" />

==Profile==
He is near-[[genius]] (with an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 155), a [[Mensa International|Mensa]] member, a graduate of the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], and a former stripper. Hibbert is noticeably less dysfunctional than just about everyone else on the show, though he does have a bizarre tendency to chuckle at inappropriate moments which is later revealed to be a coping mechanism. In "[[Make Room for Lisa]]", Hibbert tells Lisa that "Before I learned to chuckle mindlessly, I was headed to an early grave." He reacts questionably to certain medical problems. For example, when [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] saves [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] from drowning, Hibbert attributes it to common cases of superhuman strength in children whose parents' lives are in danger.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder |episode-link=Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike B. Anderson|Anderson, Mike B.]] |network=[[20th Century Fox]] |airdate=November 14, 1999 |season=11 |number=6}}</ref> Likewise, he expresses only mild surprise when both of [[Abraham Simpson|Grandpa Simpson]]'s kidneys are revealed to have exploded. In ''[[Treehouse of Horror XX]]'', Dr. Hibbert discusses the possibility of [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] being a "genetic chosen one" who can cure a [[zombie apocalypse]] over the phone with the Simpsons, while under siege from the aforementioned [[zombies]].

There are hints throughout the series that Dr. Hibbert is not above dubious medical practices. After [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] talks him out of buying an unsuitable house, he suggests repaying her with [[Underground economy|black-market]] prescriptions.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Realty Bites |episode-link=Realty Bites |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Dan Greaney|Greaney, Dan]]; Scott III, Swinton O. |network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]] |airdate=December 7, 1997 |season=9 |number=9}}</ref> When he realizes that Marge is initially unenthusiastic about having a third child, he implies that a healthy baby could bring in as much as $60,000 on the black market. Hibbert covers for himself against Marge's horrified reaction by saying that if she had replied any other way, she would be sent to prison, claiming that it is "just a test".<ref>{{cite episode |title=And Maggie Makes Three |episode-link=And Maggie Makes Three |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jennifer Crittenden|Crittenden, Jennifer]]; Scott III, Swinton O. |network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]] |airdate=January 22, 1995 |season=6 |number=13}}</ref> It is also suggested in the episode "[[Wild Barts Can't Be Broken]]" that he does not in fact have a medical license.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Wild Barts Can't Be Broken |episode-link=Wild Barts Can't Be Broken |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Larry Doyle (writer)|Doyle, Larry]]; [[Mark Ervin|Ervin, Mark]] |network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]] |airdate=January 17, 1999 |season=10 |number=11}}</ref>

Despite his seemingly honest and good-hearted personality, there is evidence that he is, at heart, a [[mercenary]]. In "[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]", Hibbert tells [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] that his [[open heart surgery]] will cost $30,000. When Homer has a [[heart attack]] in front of him in response to this news, he says, unmoved, that the cost is now $40,000 – hinting the heart attack made him now require a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple bypass]]. In "[[Bye Bye Nerdie]]", after Homer's baby-proofing business eliminates child injuries in Springfield, Hibbert complains that he is behind in his boat payments because of this. He is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and attends [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield's]] Republican meetings alongside [[Montgomery Burns|Mr Burns]], [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Rainier Wolfcastle|Rainier Wolfcastle]], and a [[Nosferatu]]-like creature. Hibbert also freely wears fur coats, believing that while fur itself may not be murder, "paying for it sure is!"<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Milhouse Divided |episode-link=A Milhouse Divided |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Tompkins, Steve; [[Steven Dean Moore|Moore, Steven Dean]] |network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]] |airdate=December 1, 1996 |season=8 |number=6}}</ref>

Hibbert is often seen in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s (for example, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa's]] birth, or [[Bart Simpson|Bart's]] accidents as a toddler), and each time has a different hairstyle ([[afro]], [[box braids|braids]], [[Mr. T]]-style [[Mohawk hairstyle|Mohawk]], etc.) appropriate for the time period.

Dr. Hibbert is married; he and his wife [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Bernice Hibbert|Bernice]] have at least three children, two boys and a girl. When his entire family is seen together, they appear to be a spoof of ''[[The Cosby Show]]''. Bernice is known to be something of a heavy drinker; this has been joked about on at least one occasion (in "[[Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment]]", she faints upon reading the news that [[Prohibition]] has been introduced in Springfield) and laughs exactly like her husband. Despite apparent marriage problems, Dr. Hibbert still requests that the Simpsons tell Bernice that he loves her during a zombie apocalypse, though Homer misinterprets the message and resolves to just give her a [[high-five]].

In the sixth season episode {{"-}}[['Round Springfield]]", it is implied that he and [[Bleeding Gums Murphy]] are long-lost brothers; Hibbert says he has a long-lost brother who is a [[jazz]] musician and Murphy says he has a brother who is a doctor that chuckles at inappropriate times, but somehow the two do not put these clues together. However, Murphy later dies, so it will never be known for certain if they are brothers or not.<ref>{{cite episode |title='Round Springfield |episode-link='Round Springfield |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Steven Dean Moore|Moore, Steven Dean]] |network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]] |airdate=April 30, 1995 |season=6 |number=22}}</ref> Hibbert also bears a striking resemblance to the director of the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Shelbyville|Shelbyville]] orphanage, who mentions a personal quest to find his long-lost twin to an indifferent Homer.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? |episode-link=Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; Archer, W.M. "Bud" |network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]] |airdate=February 21, 1991 |season=2 |number=15}}</ref> In the 1999 episode "[[Grift of the Magi]]", we learn that Dr. Hibbert lives next door to [[Chief Wiggum|Police Chief Wiggum]].

In writers [[Jay Kogen]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]]'s original script for "[[Bart the Daredevil]]", Hibbert was a woman, named "Julia Hibbert", whom they named after comedic actress [[Julia Sweeney]] (Hibbert was her married last name at the time).<ref name="sprcon">{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |authorlink1=Mike Reiss |last2=Klickstein |first2=Mathew |title=Springfield Confidential: Jokes, Secrets, and Outright Lies From a Lifetime Writing for The Simpsons |date=2018 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0062748034 |page=100|location=New York City}}</ref> When Fox moved ''The Simpsons'' to [[prime time]] on Thursdays against [[NBC]]'s [[Nielsen ratings#Annual Top-Rated Shows|top-rated]] ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', the writing staff decided to make Dr. Hibbert a parody of [[Bill Cosby]]'s character, [[Cliff Huxtable|Dr. Cliff Huxtable]].<ref name=daredevil>{{cite AV media|people=[[Matt Groening|Groening, Matt]]; [[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Jay Kogen|Kogen, Jay]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Wallace Wolodarsky|Wolodarsky, Wallace]]|date=2004|title=Commentary for "Bart the Daredevil", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season''|format=DVD|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/4308/simpsons-the-complete-second-season-the/|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}</ref> Dr. Hibbert is usually shown wearing colorful sweaters when not on duty, a reference to Huxtable.<ref name=daredevil/> Like the Cosby character, Dr. Hibbert laughs inappropriately, at pretty much everything. He is one of the few competent characters in the show, and was originally shown as being sympathetic to his patients' conditions, but that was eventually changed to him being less caring about his patients.<ref name=daredevil/>

==Cultural reception==
A [[tongue-in-cheek]] analysis in the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' (''CMAJ'') compares the services of Dr. Hibbert and [[Dr. Nick Riviera]], a quack physician often used by ''The Simpsons'' as an alternative source of medical advice. While Hibbert is praised for his sense of humor and quality of care, it concludes that Nick is a better [[role model]] for physicians; Hibbert is a paternalistic and wasteful physician, unlike Nick, who strives to cut costs and does his best to avoid the [[coroner]].<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Robert |last1=Patterson |first2=Charles |last2=Weijer |title=D'oh! An analysis of the medical care provided to the family of Homer J. Simpson |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/159/12/1480.pdf |journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] |publisher=[[Canadian Medical Association]] |location=Ottawa, Ontario, Canada |volume=159 |issue=12 |pages=1480–1 |date=December 15, 1998 |pmid=9988570 |pmc=1229893}}</ref> This study was rebutted, also in ''CMAJ'', casting both characters aside as a role model in favor of Dr. [[Leonard McCoy|Bones McCoy]] of ''[[Star Trek]]'', "TV's only true physician" and "someone who has broken free from the yoke of ethics and practises the art and science of medicine beyond the stultifying opposition of paternalism and autonomy. A free and independent thinker and, indeed, someone even beyond role models".<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Yao |date=December 15, 1998 |title=To boldly go: we have to look beyond the Simpsons for a true medical hero |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/159/12/1476.full.pdf |journal=[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] |publisher=[[Canadian Medical Association]] |location=Ottawa, Ontario, Canada |volume=159 |issue=12 |pages=1476–1477 |pmid=9988569 |pmc=1229891 |access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref>

In mid-2020, amid the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement and [[George Floyd protests]], the ''Simpsons'' producers declared their intentions to no longer use white actors to voice non-white characters; thus, Dr. Hibbert's voice actor was recast. Harry Shearer, the original voice actor, second-guessed this decision, saying all actors are hired to "play someone who they are not". This came amid similar recasting on other cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Zac|last=Ntim|url=https://www.insider.com/dr-hibbert-actor-harry-shearer-questions-the-simpsons-casting-rules-2020-8|title=The actor who plays Dr Hibbert in 'The Simpsons' questions the show's decision to stop casting white actors as characters of color|website=[[Insider.com|Insider]]|date=August 5, 2020|accessdate=June 12, 2023}}</ref> In February of the following year, it was announced that beginning with the episode "[[Wad Goals]]", voice actor [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], who is African-American, would replace Shearer as Hibbert.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56166823 |title=The Simpsons: Kevin Michael Richardson replaces Harry Shearer as Dr Hibbert |work=[[BBC News]] |date=23 February 2021 |access-date=23 February 2021}}</ref>
