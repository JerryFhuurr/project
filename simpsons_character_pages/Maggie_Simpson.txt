And for similar reasons, Maggie's middle name is Lenny.}}</ref>
is a fictional character in the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and the youngest member of the [[Simpson family]]. She first appeared on television in the ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short "[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]" on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. She is also known as the “[[baby]]” of the Simpson family. She received her first name from Groening's youngest sister. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three years, the Simpson family was given their own series on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]], which debuted on December 17, 1989.

Maggie is the youngest child of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], and the younger sister to [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. She is often seen sucking on her red [[pacifier]] and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this [[running gag]] is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she has not yet learned how to talk. However, she did appear to talk in the first ''Tracey Ullman Show'' short.

Though she rarely talks, she frequently makes a characteristic sucking noise with her pacifier, which has become synonymous with the character. Her pacifier sucking noises are provided by the show's creator, [[Matt Groening]], and early producer [[Gábor Csupó]]. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other vocalizations are currently provided by [[Nancy Cartwright]], but she has also been voiced by guest stars [[Carol Kane]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jodie Foster]], and by series regulars [[Yeardley Smith]] and [[Harry Shearer]]. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to ''The Simpsons,'' including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]], commercials and [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters do not physically age (or if they do, then very slowly), and as such the show is assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=78}} Maggie is the youngest child of [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], and younger sister to [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], impressing its owner, [[Mr. Burns]] with his aggressive submissiveness.<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episode-link=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff |network=Fox |airdate=December 19, 1991 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought [[742 Evergreen Terrace|their first house]]. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.<ref name=MaggieMakesThree>{{cite episode |title=And Maggie Makes Three |episode-link=And Maggie Makes Three |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Crittenden, Jennifer; Scott, Swinton O. |network=Fox |airdate=January 22, 1995 |season=06 |number=13}}</ref>

During the earlier seasons of the show, Maggie's equivalent of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor,{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=11}} but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has a penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=11}}

Maggie has performed a number of feats that for her age suggest she is highly intelligent, akin to her sister, and possibly a genius. She has spelled out [[E=MC²]] with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center,<ref name=NewBadge>{{cite episode |title=Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge |episode-link=A Streetcar Named Marge |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff |network=Fox |airdate=October 1, 1992 |season=4 |number=2}}</ref> written her name on an [[Etch A Sketch]],{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=11}} played Internet poker,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonsarchive.com/guides/internet.html|title=The Simpsons Archive: Internet References|first=Hari Michael|last=Wierny|date=July 3, 2010|publisher=The Simpsons Archive|access-date=August 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709073048/http://www.simpsonsarchive.com/guides/internet.html|archive-date=July 9, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> spelled words with her baby blocks, [[Who Shot Mr. Burns?|shot Mr. Burns]], played Lisa's saxophone, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, the rest of the Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy and Scratchy]]''.<ref name=ItchyScratchyMarge>{{cite episode |title=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |episode-link=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=December 20, 1990 |season=02 |number=09}}</ref> Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable [[marksman]], as seen in "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" where she shoots [[Mr. Burns]] with a handgun that falls into her hands,<ref name=Whoshotmrburns>{{cite episode |title=Who Shot Mr. Burns? |episode-link=Who Shot Mr. Burns? |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Oakley, Bill |network=Fox |airdate=May 21, 1995 |season=06 |number=25}}</ref> though whether or not it was intentional is not clear, and in a deliberate manner during "[[Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge]]" where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in her crib.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite episode |title=Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge |episode-link=Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Gould, Dana; Michels, Pete |network=Fox |airdate=May 22, 2002 |season=13 |number=22}}</ref>

==History==

===Character===

====Creation====
[[File:UllmanMaggie.png|right|thumb|Maggie in her first appearance in the Ullman short "Good Night".]]
[[Matt Groening]] conceived Maggie and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', and had intended to present an adaptation of his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strip. When he realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction,<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video |people=BBC |year=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox |access-date=June 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081722/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |archive-date=February 11, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and hurriedly sketched out his version of a [[dysfunctional family]] and named the characters after members of his own family. The baby of the family was named Maggie after Groening's youngest sister.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Matt Groening|last=Sadownick|first=Doug|author-link=Douglas Sadownick|magazine=[[The Advocate (magazine)|The Advocate]]|issue=571|date=February 26, 1991|url=https://www.simpsonsarchive.com/other/interviews/groening91.html|access-date=September 23, 2024|archive-date=September 24, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240924010418/https://www.simpsonsarchive.com/other/interviews/groening91.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003818762_realsimpsons030.html |title=The real people behind Homer Simpson and family |access-date=January 19, 2008 |last=Rose|first=Joseph |date=August 3, 2007 |work=[[The Oregonian]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525111318/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003818762_realsimpsons030.html |archive-date=May 25, 2012 }}</ref> Maggie then made her debut with the rest of the Simpsons family on April 19, 1987, in the [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]".{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14}} In 1989, the shorts were adapted into ''The Simpsons'', a half-hour series that would air on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. Maggie and the rest of the family remained the main characters on this new show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |title=3rd Degree: Harry Shearer |access-date=September 1, 2006 |last=Kuipers|first=Dean|author-link=Dean Kuipers |date=April 15, 2004 |website=[[Los Angeles City Beat]] |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archive-date=March 8, 2008}}</ref>

The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.<ref>Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> Maggie's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Lisa shares her hairline.<ref>Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "[[Principal Charming]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> While designing Maggie and Lisa, Groening "couldn't be bothered to even think about girls' hair styles".<ref name=THOHV>Silverman, David; Reardon, Jim; Groening, Matt. (2005). Illustrated commentary for "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing Lisa and Maggie, he "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".<ref>Groening, Matt. (2006). "A Bit From the Animators", illustrated commentary for "[[All Singing, All Dancing]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

Groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required.<ref name=sundvd>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Scully, Mike; Jean, Al; Brooks, James L.; Silverman, David |year=2007 |title=The Simpsons Movie: A Look Behind the Scenes |medium=DVD |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]}}</ref> Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the [[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman period]]. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.<ref>Groening, Matt. (2001). Commentary for "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

====Voice====
<!--THIS SECTION IS ''not'' FOR LISTING EVERY TIME MAGGIE HAS SPOKEN. IT IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT HER VOICE. REFER TO TALK PAGE.-->
With few exceptions, Maggie never speaks but participates in the events around her, emoting with subtle gestures and facial expressions. Maggie's first lines were spoken in "Good Night", the first short to air on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', after the family falls asleep. On this occasion, Liz Georges provided the voice of Maggie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/guides/tracey.ullman.html |title=The Simpsons on The Tracey Ullman Show |publisher=The Simpsons Archive |access-date=September 30, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511160217/http://www.snpp.com/guides/tracey.ullman.html |archive-date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>

Rather than talking, Maggie is well known for producing a characteristic "sucking" sound from her pacifier. This sound effect was originally provided by the show's creator [[Matt Groening]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/the-simpsons/11289466/25-things-you-never-knew-about-the-simpsons.html |title=25 things you never knew about The Simpsons |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=August 8, 2016 |date=December 15, 2014 |first=Michael |last=Hogan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820085806/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/the-simpsons/11289466/25-things-you-never-knew-about-the-simpsons.html |archive-date=August 20, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> for early episodes of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', and also by [[Gabor Csupo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animeexpressway.com/rugrats/rrconn2.htm|title=The Rugrats Connection|website=animeexpressway.com|access-date=August 8, 2016}}</ref> (who was also the animation executive producer, for the first 60 episodes). The sucking noise is heard in all of Maggie's appearances to date, and is usually archive audio from either of Groening or Csupo's initial recordings (from the show's early episodes). Other than her sucking noise, Maggie has been known to make other noises, such as occasional squeals and [[babbling]]. In most instances, these vocalisations are provided by either [[Nancy Cartwright]] or [[Yeardley Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonsarchive.com/guides/maggie.file.html|title=The Maggie File|publisher=The Simpsons Archive|access-date=August 8, 2016|date=August 1, 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614113227/http://www.simpsonsarchive.com/guides/maggie.file.html|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Maggie has received both popular and critical acclaim.

Some of her favorite Maggie scenes include scenes from "[[Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song]]" and "[[Lady Bouvier's Lover]]" where Maggie meets her unibrowed archenemy, [[Baby Gerald]], and the one scene from "[[Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie]]" in which Bart is supposed to babysit Maggie, but she escapes and takes Homer's car for a ride.<ref name="about.com">{{cite web |url=http://animatedtv.about.com/cs/faqs/a/simpsonbios_5.htm |title=Maggie Simpson&nbsp;– A Biography of ''Simpsons'' Baby Maggie Simpson |access-date=September 12, 2008 |last=Basile|first=Nancy |publisher=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831215824/http://animatedtv.about.com/cs/faqs/a/simpsonbios_5.htm |archive-date=August 31, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Basile also added that "whether watching '[[The Happy Little Elves|The Happy Elves]]' or falling down, Maggie is the cutest baby in the Simpson family".<ref name="about.com"/> Comedian [[Ricky Gervais]] named "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]" his second favorite episode of the show and said that the scene in the end where Homer puts up pictures of Maggie over his desk gave him "a lump in the throat thinking about it".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://ew.com/article/2006/03/24/ricky-gervais-rates-simpsons/ |title=Best in D'oh |access-date=September 12, 2008 |date=March 24, 2006 |last=Snierson|first=Dan |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019065222/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C1176431%2C00.html |archive-date=October 19, 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Todd Everett at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the scene in "[[Lisa's First Word]]" where Maggie speaks her first word "quite a heart-melter".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117900193.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |title=The Simpsons Maggie's First Word |last=Everett |first=Todd |date=December 7, 1992 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=September 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028031358/http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117900193.html?categoryid=32&cs=1 |archive-date=October 28, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== ''Maggie Simpson in…'' ==
''Maggie Simpson in…'' is a series of animated short-films. It currently consists of four films. The movies put Maggie at the center of the story, unlike most episodes of the show itself. All the films retain the theme of the first film – Maggie's journey to day care (or in the case of ''[[Playdate with Destiny]]'', the playground).

Maggie starred in the 3D short-film ''[[The Longest Daycare]]'', which was shown in theaters before ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |last=Arbeiter|first=Michael |date=May 21, 2012 |title='Simpsons' Back on the Big Screen: 'Ice Age 4' Debuts 3D Short |work=[[Hollywood.com]] |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Simpsons_Movie_Ice_Age_4_Maggie_3D_Short/28162969 |url-status=live |access-date=May 21, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121209081757/http://www.hollywood.com/news/Simpsons_Movie_Ice_Age_4_Maggie_3D_Short/28162969 |archive-date=December 9, 2012}}</ref>
