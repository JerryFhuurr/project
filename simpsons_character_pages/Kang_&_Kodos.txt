Kang is voiced by [[Harry Shearer]] and Kodos is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. They are green, perpetually drooling, [[octopus]]-like [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] from the fictional planet Rigel VII and appear almost exclusively in the "[[Treehouse of Horror]]" episodes. The duo has appeared in at least one segment of all thirty-six Treehouse of Horror episodes. Sometimes, their appearance is the focus of a plot. Other times, it is a brief cameo. Kang and Kodos are often bent on the conquest of Earth and are usually seen working on sinister plans to invade and subjugate humanity.

The duo first appeared in [[The Simpsons season 2|season two]]'s "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]". The first drawing of Kang and Kodos came from writers [[Jay Kogen]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]]. The finished design was based on an [[EC Comics]] issue cover. Kang and Kodos had brief cameo appearances in several non-"Treehouse of Horror" episodes and have appeared as villains in several of [[List of The Simpsons video games|''The Simpsons'' video games]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Kang and Kodos are Rigellians from the planet Rigel VII. Their bodies resemble cephalopods, and they wear transparent breathing helmets. They are virtually identical in appearance, though Kang's voice is deeper. They speak "Rigellian", which is coincidentally exactly the same as English. In most appearances they are antagonistic towards humanity. One exception is their first appearance in "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror]]" segment "Hungry are the Damned". In this segment they capture the [[Simpson family]] and feed them exquisite cuisine.<ref name="I">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror|episode-link=Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode) |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Simon, Sam; Archer, Wes; Moore, Rich; Silverman, David|network=Fox |airdate=1990-10-25 |season=2 |number=03}}</ref> [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] becomes suspicious of their intentions and accuses Kang and Kodos of wanting to eat the Simpson family upon finding a cookbook she believes to be called ''How to Cook Humans.'' However, the book was actually called ''How to Cook for Forty Humans'' with part of the title obscured by space dust. Kang and Kodos deny the accusation of wanting to eat them, revealing that they abducted the Simpsons in order to offer them paradise on Rigel VII. However, thanks to Lisa's accusation, they are offended and hurt and so send the Simpsons back home.<ref name="I"/>

Kang and Kodos have invaded the Earth on several occasions, with varying results. It is notable that they are unaware of Earth's politics and culture, for example, in the 1995 episode "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]" they are [[hitchhiking]] in the [[Nevada]] desert and are holding up a sign that says "Earth Capital", implying that they are guilty of Critical Research Failure. In the 1996 episode "[[Treehouse of Horror VII]]", Kang and Kodos impersonated [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]] and ran against each other in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]], where the alien duo is once again unaware that the United States is only a small part of the Earth. After convincing Americans that voting for a [[Minor party|third-party]] candidate would be a [[wasted vote|waste of a vote]], Kang was elected president.<ref name="VII">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror VII|episode-link=Treehouse of Horror VII|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Keeler, Ken; Greaney, Dan; Cohen, David S.; Anderson, Mike B.|network=Fox |airdate=1996-10-27 |season=08 |number=01}}</ref> In [[Treehouse of Horror II|their second appearance]], they decided to take over the Earth after citizens had declared [[world peace]] but it ultimately failed. This was because ''[[Moe Szyslak|Moe]]'' and only ''Moe'', chased them away with a "board with a nail in it", [[Stupidity|despite their species' superior technology]].<ref name="II"/> Kang and Kodos's religion is "Quantum [[Presbyterianism]]",<ref name="Gump"/> although Kodos later claims to be [[Jewish]].<ref name="XVIII"/> Other Rigellians that have appeared include Serak the Preparer, who was voiced by [[James Earl Jones]] and only appeared in the original "Treehouse of Horror" episode.<ref name="I"/>

Kang and Kodos have appeared in every "Treehouse of Horror" episode to date, and have played major roles in "[[Treehouse of Horror (The Simpsons episode)|Treehouse of Horror I]]",<ref name="I"/> "[[Treehouse of Horror II]]",<ref name="II">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror II|episode-link=Treehouse of Horror II|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Meyer, George; Reiss, Mike; Jean, Al; Martin, Jeff; Simon, Sam; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-31 |season=3 |number=07}}</ref> "[[Treehouse of Horror VII]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror IX]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]",<ref name="XVII">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XVII|episode-link=Treehouse of Horror XVII|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Gaffney, Peter; Silverman, David; Faughnan, Matthew|network=Fox |airdate=2006-11-05 |season=18 |number=04}}</ref> "[[Treehouse of Horror XVIII]]",<ref name="XVIII">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror XVIII|episode-link=Treehouse of Horror XVIII|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Wilmore, Marc; Sheetz, Chuck|network=Fox |airdate=2007-11-04 |season=19 |number=05}}</ref> "[[Treehouse of Horror XXII]]" and "[[Treehouse of Horror XXX]]".

Kang and Kodos's cameo appearances normally occur in the midst of segments, which will suddenly cut away to the duo. For example, Kang and Kodos observe zombies attacking Earth from space. The duo laugh maniacally at the Earthlings' suffering, before the scene is switched back from space to Earth.<ref name="III">{{cite episode |title=Treehouse of Horror III|episode-link=Treehouse of Horror III |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Simon, Sam and Vitti, Jon|network=Fox |airdate=1992-10-29|season=04|number=05}}</ref> Kang and Kodos have made rare appearances in non-"Treehouse of Horror" episodes, such as "[[Behind the Laughter]]"<ref>{{cite episode |title=Behind the Laughter|episode-link=Behind the Laughter|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Long, Tim; Meyer, George; Scully, Mike; Selman, Matt; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox |airdate=2000-05-21 |season=11 |number=22}}</ref> and "[[Gump Roast]]",<ref name="Gump">{{cite episode |title=Gump Roast|episode-link=Gump Roast|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Lacusta, Deb; Castellaneta, Dan; Kirkland, Mark|network=Fox |airdate=2002-04-21 |season=13 |number=17}}</ref> and had a non-speaking cameo in "[[The Springfield Files]]" on a line-up with other aliens.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Springfield Files|episode-link=The Springfield Files|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Harrison, Reis; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=1997-01-12 |season=08|number=10}}</ref>

Kang and Kodos first appeared in the [[The Simpsons season 2|second season]] in "Treehouse of Horror". The idea of Kang and Kodos came from [[Jay Kogen]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], writers of "Hungry are the Damned".<ref name="Kogen1"/> In the script, Kang and Kodos were shown as "an octopus in a space helmet with a trail of goo".<ref name="Kogen1">{{cite video | people=Kogen, Jay|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The finished design was based on an [[EC Comics]] cover issue.<ref name="Reiss2">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror II'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="sprcon">{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |author-link1=Mike Reiss |title=Springfield confidential: jokes, secrets, and outright lies from a lifetime writing for the Simpsons |last2=Klickstein |first2=Mathew |date=2018 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0062748034 |location=New York City |page=102}}</ref> Although originally designed to constantly drool, [[Matt Groening]] suggested that they not drool all the time to make the animation process easier. However, the animators did not mind the work, leading to the drooling staying in the script.<ref name="Groening1"/> Kang and Kodos's names are derived from two ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' characters. [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]] was a [[Klingon]] captain portrayed by actor [[Michael Ansara]] in "[[Day of the Dove]]", whereas Kodos the Executioner was a human villain from "[[The Conscience of the King]]".<ref name="Reiss1">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2003|title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Harry Shearer]] voices Kang, and [[Dan Castellaneta]] voices Kodos.<ref name="Groening1"/> An unofficial rule for the writers is that Kang and Kodos must appear in every Halloween episode.<ref name="Jean1">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Despite this rule, the writers say the duo will often be forgotten and are only added at the last second, leading to brief appearances.<ref name="Groening1">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Development===
Traditionally, Kang and Kodos appeared in every single ''Treehouse of Horror'' episode as a part of a story's plotline or as cameos. They almost did not make the cut in "[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]", but [[David X. Cohen]] managed to persuade the producers to keep the scene.<ref name="Cohen8">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X. |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror VIII'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Kang, however, did not appear in "[[Treehouse of Horror XXI]]". Kang and Kodos were originally going to make regular appearances in the show. One idea was only [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] would be able to see them and everyone else thinking Homer is crazy when he talked about the aliens. However, the concept was "too far out", leading to characters only featured in the "Treehouse of Horror" specials.<ref name=tvguide>{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|date=2000-10-21|work=[[TV Guide]]|first=Joe|last=Rhodes}}</ref> In some appearances, Kang and Kodos will laugh hysterically for several seconds; this was suggested by [[Sam Simon]]. During production, the episodes would often be too short; therefore, to make more time, their laughter was lengthened.<ref name="Jean2">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror II'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

The gender and sexuality of the Kang and Kodos has been portrayed in different ways throughout the series. They are typically depicted as male, but Kodos was identified as Kang's sister in the [[The Simpsons season 8|eighth-season]] episode "[[Treehouse of Horror VII]]", and they were identified as a lesbian couple in the [[The Simpsons season 26|26th-season]] episode "[[Simpsorama]]". Producer Al Jean has described their gender as intentionally vague, with the show sometimes implying that they were [[androgynous]]. After the episode "Simpsorama", Jean confirmed that "they're a gay female couple" and that they "seemed to be married".<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=2014-11-10 |title='Simpsons' producer on the surprising Kang and Kodos revelation, 'death' of Ralph Wiggum |url=https://ew.com/article/2014/11/10/simpsons-death-ralph-wiggum-kang-kodos/ |access-date=2023-04-14 |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |language=en |archive-date=2020-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201122024614/https://ew.com/article/2014/11/10/simpsons-death-ralph-wiggum-kang-kodos/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kodos' gender has come into debate from fans. In "[[Treehouse of Horror VII]]", Kang introduces Kodos with "This is my sister Kodos". The line was pitched by [[George Meyer]]<ref name="Cohen7">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X. |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror VII'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and was even somewhat followed in later episodes as the writers tried to make Kang the more dominant of the two.<ref name="Cohen9">{{cite video | people=Cohen, David X. |year=2006|title=The Simpsons season 9 DVD commentary for the episode 'Treehouse of Horror IX'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In previous and subsequent episodes, Kodos has been referred to as a male.<ref name="XVIII"/> In ''[[The Simpsons: Tapped Out]]'' video game, Kodos, but not Kang, is sent on a mission that only female characters are allowed to complete. In the ''[[Futurama]]'' crossover episode "[[Simpsorama]]", Kang and Kodos, referred to as "the Johnsons", visit recurring ''Futurama'' characters [[List of Futurama characters#Lrrr|Lrrr]] and Ndnd for dinner in the 31st century, and both identify themselves as female. In an interview after the episode aired, producer [[Al Jean]] confirmed that Kang and Kodos Johnson are "a gay female couple in their species".<ref name="Jean2014"/> In the epilogue of "[[Treehouse of Horror XXXIII]]", Kodos is referred to with male pronouns which is presumably an error.

===Other appearances===
[[File:Face of Kang & Kodos Twirl n Hurl Springfield U S A.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Kang & Kodos' Twirl 'n' Hurl]], [[Universal Studios Florida]]]]
Kang and Kodos have appeared in several different [[List of The Simpsons video games|''The Simpsons'' video games]]. The duo appear in ''[[The Simpsons: Road Rage]]'' ending, and Kang appears as the final boss character in ''[[The Simpsons Wrestling]]'' game.

Kang and Kodos appear in [[cutscene]]s as the main villains in 2003's ''[[The Simpsons: Hit & Run]]''. In an attempt to collect new material for their failing reality TV show ''Foolish Earthlings'', Kang and Kodos plan to drug Springfield with a mind-control serum distributed through their "New and Improved Buzz Cola" product. After drinking the cola, the brainwashed people performed stupid stunts under the watchful view of [[wasp]]-like [[surveillance cameras]], all for the sake of better ratings.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Simpsons: Hit and Run | website = [[IGN]] | date = 2008-08-23 | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/435/435913p1.html | access-date=2008-05-11|first=Douglass C.|last=Perry}}</ref>

They also appeared as villains in ''[[The Simpsons Game]]'' along with an army of other Rigellians, but like ''Hit & Run'', Kang and Kodos only appear in cutscenes.

In ''[[The Simpsons: Tapped Out]]'', Kang was a premium character for 2012 Halloween and Kodos followed in the 2013 Halloween event.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://screenrant.com/kang-conqueror-simpsons-treehouse-horror-marvel-alien-similarities/ | title=Everything Marvel's Kang Has in Common with the Simpsons' Version | website=[[Screen Rant]] | date=October 15, 2021 }}</ref>

In 2001, Kang and Kodos were made into separate action figures in the ''[[World of Springfield]]'' toy line. Along with their spaceship, Kang and Kodos were included with the "Treehouse of Horror II" set exclusive to [[Toys "R" Us]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonscollectors.com/wospdb/figure.asp?fig=F0047|title=Kang|access-date=2008-05-11|publisher=Simpsons Collectors|archive-date=July 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075146/http://www.simpsonscollectors.com/wospdb/figure.asp?fig=F0047|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonscollectors.com/wospdb/figure.asp?fig=F0048|title=Kodos|access-date=2008-05-11|publisher=Simpsons Collectors|archive-date=July 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716075210/http://www.simpsonscollectors.com/wospdb/figure.asp?fig=F0048|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonscollectors.com/wospdb/environment.asp?env=E0010|title=THOH II, Alien Ship|access-date=2008-05-11|publisher=Simpsons Collectors|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524134644/http://www.simpsonscollectors.com/wospdb/environment.asp?env=E0010|archive-date=2006-05-24}}</ref>

Kang and Kodos also have a brief cameo in [[The Simpsons Ride]] with only Kodos speaking due to Harry Shearer declining to reprise his voice roles for the ride supposedly due to scheduling and availability conflicts as the cast recordings were scheduled during the production break between seasons, where voice actors would have time off.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://travel.latimes.com/daily-deal-blog/?p=1657 |title=Simpsons ride features 29 characters, original voices|access-date=2008-05-11|date=2008-04-09|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Brady|last=MacDonald}}</ref>

In 2013, a separate ride called [[Kang & Kodos' Twirl 'n' Hurl]] was added in the vicinity of ''The Simpsons Ride'' in [[Universal Studios Florida]] park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universalorlando.com/Rides/Universal-Studios-Florida/Kang-and-Kodos.aspx |title=Kang & Kodos' Twirl 'n' Hurl|access-date=2014-11-13|publisher=Universal Studios}}</ref>

In 2009, Kang and Kodos were also made into six-inch collectible vinyl art toys by Kidrobot x The Simpsons. Kang was sculpted salivating and included the book ''How to Cook for Forty Humans'' as an accessory. Kodos was the [[chase figure]] in the release, and the accessory included was a space gun. Both were released again by Kidrobot x The Simpsons for The Treehouse of Horrors three-inch Blind Box release, along with ten other characters from the Treehouse series, in September 2013.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thegamer.com/simpsons-collectible-price-guide/ | title=The Rarest the Simpsons Toys and What They're Worth | date=November 2, 2018 }}</ref>

==Reception==
Several of the "Treehouse of Horror" episodes featuring the duo have been well received.
