'''Apu Nahasapeemapetilon''' is a  character in the American [[Animated cartoon|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]].'' He mostly appeared in episodes from 1990 to 2017. He is an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[immigrant]] proprietor who ran the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], a popular convenience store in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], and was known for his catchphrase, "thank you, come again".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-simpsons/articles/apu-nahasapeemapetilon |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026044656/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-simpsons/articles/apu-nahasapeemapetilon |archive-date=October 26, 2012 |title=Apu Nahasapeemapetilon |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |author=Matt Groening |year=2009 |access-date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> He was voiced by [[Hank Azaria]] and first appeared in the episode "[[The Telltale Head]]". He was named in honor of the title character of ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' by [[Satyajit Ray]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Reiss |first=Mike |title=Springfield Confidential |year=2018}}</ref>

A 2017 documentary, ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'', written by and starring comedian [[Hari Kondabolu]], criticized the character as a [[Stereotypes of South Asians|South Asian stereotype]]. In January 2020, Azaria reacted to this by announcing that he and the production crew of the series had agreed for him to step down as the voice of Apu. The final time that Azaria voiced Apu was in the [[The Simpsons season 29|season 29]] premiere "[[The Serfsons]]" in 2017; since then, he has appeared only as a background character with little to no visibility.

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
===Biography===
In the episode "[[Homer and Apu]]", Apu says he is from [[Rahmatpur]], [[West Bengal]]. Apu is a [[naturalization|naturalized]] American citizen, and he holds a Ph.D. in [[computer science]]. He graduated first in his class of seven million at 'Caltech'&nbsp;– [[Calcutta]] Technical Institute&nbsp;– going on to earn his doctorate at the Springfield Heights Institute of Technology.<ref>{{cite web|first=Brian|last=Boon|url=https://www.looper.com/90004/jokes-references-missed-simpsons/|title=Jokes and references you missed in ''The Simpsons''|website=[[looper.com]]|date=October 9, 2017}}</ref>

Apu began working at the Kwik-E-Mart during graduate school to pay off his [[student loan]]; he stayed afterwards as he enjoyed his job and the friends he had made. He remained an [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]] until [[Mayor Quimby]] [[Much Apu About Nothing|proposed a municipal law to expel all undocumented aliens]]. Apu responded by purchasing a forged birth certificate from the [[Springfield Mafia]] that listed his parents as American citizens Herb and Judy Nahasapeemapetilon from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]]. When, however, he realized he was forsaking his origins, he abandoned this plan and instead successfully managed to pass his citizenship test with help from [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Homer Simpson]]. Thus, he refers to himself as a "semi-legal alien".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Much Apu About Nothing|episode-link=Much Apu About Nothing|series=The Simpsons|series-link=The Simpsons|credits=[[David X. Cohen|Cohen, David S.]], [[Susie Dietter|Dietter, Susie]]|network=Fox|airdate=May 5, 1996|season=7|number=23}}</ref>

In 1985, Apu was a member of the [[Barbershop music|barbershop quartet]] [[Homer's Barbershop Quartet|The Be Sharps]], along with Homer Simpson, [[Barney Gumble]], and Principal [[Seymour Skinner]]. Upon the advice of the band manager, Nigel, Apu took the stage name "Apu de Beaumarchais" (a reference to [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], author of ''[[The Barber of Seville (play)|The Barber of Seville]]'').<ref>{{cite episode |title= Homer's Barbershop Quartet |episode-link=Homer's Barbershop Quartet |series=The Simpsons |series-link= The Simpsons |credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]] |network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]] |airdate=September 30, 1993|season=5 |number= 1 }}</ref> Apu is a dietary [[vegan]], as revealed in the [[The Simpsons season 7|season 7]] episode "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]".<ref>Davé, Shilpa;  Nishime, LeiLani; Oren, Tasha G.

===Family===
In the episode "[[The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons]]", Apu enjoys a brief period as Springfield's leading ladies' man after being spontaneously drawn into a bachelor auction. He spends the days following the auction on a whirlwind of dates, which suddenly ends when his mother announces his [[arranged marriage]] to a woman named [[Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon|Manjula]], whom he had not seen since childhood. Apu tries to get out of the arrangement at first, with [[Marge Simpson]] pretending to be his wife, until Apu's mother finds her with Homer. However, he is won over when he meets Manjula at the wedding, and the two decide to give the marriage a try, with Manjula noting nonchalantly that they can always get a divorce. Later, the two actually fall in love.

In the episode "[[Eight Misbehavin']]{{-"}}, Manjula receives too many doses of [[fertility drugs]], leading to her giving [[Multiple birth|birth to octuplets]]: Anoop, Uma, Nabendu, Poonam, Pria, Sandeep, Sashi, and Gheet.{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=534}} This causes difficulties for the family but finally they decide to get on with their lives. During the episode "[[Bart-Mangled Banner]]", when the town changes its name to Libertyville to be patriotic after it is claimed Springfield hates America, Apu temporarily changes his children's names to [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], [[Freedom]], [[Condoleezza Rice|Condoleezza]], [[Coca-Cola|Coke]], [[Pepsi]], [[Manifest Destiny]], [[Apple Pie]], and [[Superman]].

Apu and Manjula have a mostly happy marriage, despite understandable marital problems caused by Apu's [[workaholic]] nature and long hours, and the strain of caring for eight children. A strain came up when Manjula learned that Apu works longer than he needs to, resulting in Apu [[I'm with Cupid|showering Manjula with many gifts]]. A further strain came up when Apu was [[The Sweetest Apu|unfaithful]] to Manjula, causing him to briefly move out and even making him contemplate suicide.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Apu |episode-link=The Sweetest Apu |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder, John]]; [[Matthew Nastuk|Nastuk, Matthew]] |network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]]|airdate=May 5, 2002|season=13 |number=19 }}</ref> He and his family are devout [[Hindus]], and he particularly venerates [[Ganesha]].<ref>''"I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge."''</ref>

[[Sanjay Nahasapeemapetilon|Sanjay]] (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]), Apu's brother, helps run the Kwik-E-Mart. Sanjay has a daughter named Pahasatira, and a son named Jamshed, all of whom share the Nahasapeemapetilon surname. Apu has another younger brother, who is only mentioned in "[[The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons]]", where Apu was shown on a chart as the oldest of three. Apu also has a cousin living in India named Kavi, also voiced by Azaria, who helped Homer while he was in India. Kavi works for several American companies taking service calls using [[General American]], cowboy, and Jamaican accents.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore |episode-link=Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Dan Castellaneta|Castellaneta, Dan]]; [[Deb Lacusta|Lacusta, Deb]]; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]] |network=Fox |airdate=April 9, 2006|season=17 |number=17 }}</ref>

== Character ==
[[File:Hankazaria05.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hank Azaria]] voiced Apu from the start of the show until 2017, when he stepped down.]]
Apu first appeared in the [[The Simpsons season 1|season one]] episode "[[The Telltale Head]]". [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] claim that while creating the character, the writers decided they would not make him ethnic, as they felt it would be too offensive and stereotypical and did not want to offend viewers,<ref name=JeanTTH>{{cite video|people=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]|date=2001|title=The Simpsons|type=Season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "The Telltale Head"|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="sprcon">{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |last2=Klickstein |first2=Mathew |title=Springfield confidential: jokes, secrets, and outright lies from a lifetime writing for the Simpsons |date=2018 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0062748034 |page=107|location=New York City}}</ref> but that the concept stayed because [[Hank Azaria]]'s reading of the line "Hello, Mr. Homer" received a huge laugh from the writers.<ref name=tvguide>{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 ''Simpsons'' Stars Reveal Themselves|date=October 21, 2000|work=[[TV Guide]]|author=Joe Rhodes}}</ref> Azaria, however, has disputed this account, claiming instead that the writers asked him to create a stereotypical Indian accent for the character.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" /> Azaria has said that he based Apu's voice on Indian [[convenience store]] workers in [[Los Angeles]] with whom he had interacted when he first moved to the area. He also loosely based it on [[Peter Sellers]]' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film ''[[The Party (1968 film)|The Party]]'' (1968), who Azaria thinks has a similar personality to Apu.<ref name=freshair>{{cite interview| last = Azaria| first = Hank| interviewer = [[Terry Gross]]| title = Fresh Air| work = [[National Public Radio]]| publisher = [[WHYY-FM]]| url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679119| location = Philadelphia| date = December 6, 2004| access-date = August 15, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419064355/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679119| archive-date = April 19, 2008| url-status = live}}</ref>

Apu's first name is a homage to the main character in ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'', directed by [[Satyajit Ray]].<ref name="tvguide" /> His surname is a scrambled version of "Pahasadee Napetilon", the full name of a schoolmate of ''Simpsons'' writer [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]].

=== Accusations of racial stereotyping ===
Apu's portrayal has been accused by many as being a [[Racism|racist]] [[caricature]] of Indians and South Asians in general and was criticized as showing bias along racial/ethnic lines and called "brownvoice" (similar to "[[blackface]]").<ref>{{cite news|last=Vij|first=Manish|title=The Apu travesty|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/16/theaputragedy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=July 16, 2007|access-date=December 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116062520/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/16/theaputragedy|archive-date=January 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|first=Mallika|last=Rao|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/11/master-of-none-recap-season-1-episode-4.html|title=Let's Talk About the Apu Accent|website=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|date=November 13, 2015|access-date=May 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510032116/http://www.vulture.com/2015/11/master-of-none-recap-season-1-episode-4.html|archive-date=May 10, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="tyfr20">{{cite book|title=Ethics, Ethnocentrism and Social Science Research|edition=1|year=2020|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9780429270260|last=Juluri|first=Vamsee|chapter=Ethnocentrism, errors, and bias in media and media studies}}</ref> During the 2007 7-Eleven promotion, many [[Indian Americans]] voiced concerns that Apu is a caricature and plays on too many negative stereotypes.

In 2016, Kondabolu announced his intention to produce a documentary about "how this controversial caricature was created, burrowed its way into the hearts and minds of Americans and continues to exist – intact – twenty-six years later".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.colorlines.com/articles/trutv-greenlights-feature-length-documentary-and-pilot-hari-kondabolu|title=TruTV Greenlights Feature-Length Documentary and Pilot From Hari Kondabolu|last=Rao|first=Sameer|date=May 11, 2016|website=Colorlines|access-date=May 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524025509/http://www.colorlines.com/articles/trutv-greenlights-feature-length-documentary-and-pilot-hari-kondabolu|archive-date=May 24, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, Kondabolu released the hour-long documentary ''[[The Problem with Apu]]'', in which he interviews actors and comics of South Asian heritage about the impact that the character of Apu has had on their lives and the perception of South Asians in American culture.<ref name="Ito, 2017">{{cite news|last1=Ito|first1=Robert|title=You Love ''The Simpsons''?

In April 2018, ''The Simpsons'' reacted to the controversy surrounding Apu in the episode "[[No Good Read Goes Unpunished]]". Marge introduces Lisa to her favorite childhood book, but is shocked by its racist stereotypes and attempts to rewrite it to suit modern sensitivities. Lisa is bored by this revised version, and Marge asks what she should do; Lisa replies "It's hard to say. Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?" She then looks at a picture of Apu with "Don't have a cow, man" written on it, and the two characters say that the issue will be dealt with later, if at all. Kondabolu said that he was saddened by the show's dismissive take on the controversy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harmon|first1=Steph|title='Don't have a cow': ''The Simpsons'' response to Apu racism row criticised as 'toothless'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/10/dont-have-a-cow-the-simpsons-response-to-apu-racism-row-criticised-as-toothless|access-date=April 12, 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=April 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411120955/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/10/dont-have-a-cow-the-simpsons-response-to-apu-racism-row-criticised-as-toothless|archive-date=April 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Mike Reiss]], ''The Simpsons''' longtime writer and producer, acknowledged the problem, and pointed out that Apu had not had a line in the show for the last three years.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Reiss|url=https://www.salon.com/tv/e/570070/c/3950|title=Why Apu Hasn't Had a Line on ''The Simpsons'' in Three Years|website=[[Salon.com]]|date=October 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031175312/https://www.salon.com/tv/e/570070/c/3950 |archive-date=October 31, 2018}}</ref>
