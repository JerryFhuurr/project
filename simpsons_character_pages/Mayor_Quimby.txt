'''Joseph Fitzgerald O'Malley Fitzpatrick Culverstone O'Donnell Edward Martin Marshall William Washington Quimby Jr.''' "'''the Edge'''"/"'''Joe'''" '''Quimby''',<ref>{{cite episode |title=Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes |episode-link=Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=Fox |airdate=2008-09-28 |season=20 |number=1 |time=0:49 |credits=Curran, Kevin; Kramer, Lance}}</ref>{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=958}} nicknamed "'''Diamond Joe'''",{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=272}} is a recurring character from the [[Animated cartoon|animated sitcom television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]], and first appeared in the episode "[[Bart Gets an 'F']]{{-"}}. Quimby is the corrupt [[mayor]] of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], and is a [[Composite character|composite]] [[parody]] of U.S. Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] and certain other members of the [[Kennedy family]] who have entered politics.

==Concept and creation==
Joe Quimby is a parody of [[Massachusetts]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy]] and the [[Kennedy family]].{{r|brown20070702}} Like the Kennedys, Quimby [[Irish Americans|is of Irish descent]], "speaks with a [[Boston accent]], throws money at political problems, and vacations in a coastal resort called the '[[Kennedy Compound|Quimby Compound]]{{'"}}.{{r|brown20070702}} Dan Castellaneta voices Quimby with a [[Northeastern elite accent|Boston elite accent]], resulting in a voice reminiscent of that of President [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for the episode "[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. Twentieth Century Fox.</ref>

==Appearances==
Quimby has long served as the [[mayor]] of the city of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. He appears as a slick, opportunistic politician whose chief priorities seem to be keeping himself in office and various other forms of corruption, including [[embezzlement|embezzling]] tax money, taking [[bribery|bribes]] from [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony]], and giving monthly [[Political corruption#Kickbacks|kickbacks]] to Police [[Chief Wiggum]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer the Vigilante|episode-link=Homer the Vigilante|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Reardon, Jim; Swartzwelder, John |network=Fox |airdate=1994-01-06|season=5 |number=11 }}</ref> The seal on the wall of his office reads "Corruptus in Extremis",<ref>{{cite episode |title=Marge in Chains|episode-link=Marge in Chains|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Bill Oakley; Josh Weinstein; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-06|season=4|number=21 }}</ref> which means "extremely corrupt". He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]].

Like Kennedy, Quimby is known as a [[wikt:womanizer|womanizer]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ghaly |first1=Sera Jane |title=High Culture: 10 Of The Best Cannabis Moments On The Simpsons |url=https://herb.co/news/culture/10-best-cannabis-moments-simpsons/ |work=[[Herb (company)|Herb]] |date=2022-12-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Sachleben |first1=Mark |last2=Yenerall |first2=Kevan M |title=Seeing the Bigger Picture Understanding Politics Through Film & Television |date=2004 |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Lang]] |location=Switzerland |isbn=9780820462486 |page=161}}</ref> and occasionally amuses himself with [[Pornography|pornographic]] [[playing card]]s during town meetings. Quimby was once the subject of 27 separate [[Paternity (law)|paternity suit]]s. One of the women he impregnated is [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Cookie Kwan|Cookie Kwan]], whose baby is remarkably similar to Quimby in both looks and mannerisms.<ref>{{cite episode |title=She Used to Be My Girl|episode-link=She Used to Be My Girl|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Nastuk, Matthew; Long, Tim |network=Fox |airdate=2004-12-05|season=16 |number=4 }}</ref> Quimby also is frequently noticed in bed with the same or similar blonde woman/women, at least one of whom was [[Miss Springfield]].<ref name="Stephanie1">{{cite episode |title=See Homer Run|episode-link=See Homer Run|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Kruse, Nancy; Gillis, Stephanie |network=Fox |airdate=2005-11-20|season=17 |number=6 }}</ref> He also once accidentally courted his own niece, which is one of the few things Quimby has ever shown shame over.

Despite being the mayor for such a long time, Quimby does not know or care much about his city, often privately (or even publicly) showing his outright contempt for Springfield's citizens.<ref name=Slate2013-05-17/> He frequently takes overseas vacations, which take him out of town for extended periods of time, leading to the headline "Mayor Visits City" in the ''Springfield Shopper''. He once referred to Springfield as "Springfeld" at a public meeting. However, he makes frequent, albeit short, public appearances for local festivities, events, business openings, etc.

If bending the law will suit Quimby's purposes, he will likely do so. He once arranged [[Marge Simpson]]'s release after she was arrested for blocking traffic on a bridge after suffering a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]], claiming that if she went to jail, Quimby could kiss the "chick vote" goodbye.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer Alone|episode-link=Homer Alone|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Kirkland, Mark; Stern, David M. |network=Fox |airdate=1992-02-06|season=3 |number=15 }}</ref> He also resorted to bribing witnesses when assault charges were brought against his nephew, leading [[Bart Simpson]] to observe that "the system works: just ask [[Claus von Bülow]]".<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Boy Who Knew Too Much|episode-link=The Boy Who Knew Too Much (The Simpsons)|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Lynch, Jeffrey; Swartzwelder, John |network=Fox |airdate=1994-05-05|season=5 |number=20 }}</ref>

His [[catchphrase]] is "Vote Quimby", which he always finds an opportunity to say, even in situations where it would be disadvantageous to identify himself, like inadvertently being caught by Homer in a motel room with his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]].

Quimby was elected Mayor of Springfield in 1986 (three years before the show's debut) and has been re-elected several times since, despite openly admitting to fraud and wrongdoing. In the season 4 episode "[[Krusty Gets Kancelled]]" he admits to using taxpayer dollars to fund the [[murder]] of his enemies, but thanks to a clever use of a popular Gabbo catchphrase ("I'm a bad wittle boy"), he is re-elected in a landslide.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Krusty Gets Kancelled|episode-link=Krusty Gets Kancelled |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Silverman, David; Swartzwelder, John |network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-13 |season=4 |number=22 }}</ref>

[[Image:Dan Castellaneta 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Dan Castellaneta]], the voice of Quimby.]]
Quimby's political stranglehold on Springfield has earned him the hatred of Springfield's small but vocal [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] elite, themselves portrayed as mostly dark, ghoulish figures who meet in a castle. When the Republicans nominate [[Sideshow Bob]] as their mayoral candidate, Bob rigs the election, briefly deposing Quimby. He is re-instated when Bob is found guilty of fraud and imprisoned.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Sideshow Bob Roberts|episode-link=Sideshow Bob Roberts |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Kirkland, Mark; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh |network=Fox |airdate=1994-10-09 |season=6 |number=5 }}</ref> Later, when Quimby briefly flees the city in the mistaken belief that his corruption is about to be exposed, he is deemed to have "abandoned office" and is replaced by a short-lived "council of learned citizens" headed by [[Lisa Simpson]], [[Professor Frink]], [[Comic Book Guy]], [[Lindsey Naegle]], [[Dr. Hibbert]], and [[Principal Skinner]], the members of the Springfield chapter of [[Mensa International]], in accordance with the town charter.<ref>{{cite episode |title=They Saved Lisa's Brain|episode-link=They Saved Lisa's Brain|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Michels, Pete; Selman, Matt |network=Fox |airdate=1999-05-09 |season=10 |number=22 }}</ref> He also survives a [[recall election]], with no candidate in the race against him (candidates include [[Rainier Wolfcastle]] (a [[California recall election, 2003|Schwarzenegger reference]]), [[Kent Brockman]], and even [[Homer Simpson]] in character as the Safety Salamander) garnering the five percent necessary to force a recall.<ref name="Stephanie1"/>

==Reception==
Literary critic [[Paul Cantor]] has cited Mayor Quimby as an example of Springfield's [[Atomism (social)|atomistic politics]], noting "Mayor Quimby is a demagogue, but at least he is Springfield's own demagogue. When he buys votes, he buys them directly from the citizens of Springfield."<ref>{{cite journal
