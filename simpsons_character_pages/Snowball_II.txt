The '''Simpson family''' are the titular main characters featured in the [[Animated series|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. The Simpsons are a [[nuclear family]] consisting of married couple [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and their three children, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. They live at [[The Simpsons house|742 Evergreen Terrace]] in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], United States. They were created by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]], who conceived the characters after his own family members, substituting "Bart" for his own name. The family debuted on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on April 19, 1987, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]" and were later spun off into their own series, which debuted on Fox in the United States on December 17, 1989, and started airing in Winter 1990.

Alongside the five main family members are Homer's father [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham "Grampa" Simpson]], Marge's sisters [[Patty and Selma Bouvier]], and the family's two pets, [[Santa's Little Helper]] and [[#Snowball II|Snowball V]]; all of them feature in major supporting roles. Other, less prominent relatives that appear infrequently include Marge's mother [[#Jacqueline Bouvier|Jacqueline Bouvier]], Homer's mother [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona Simpson]], his half-brother [[#Herbert Powell|Herb Powell]] and minor relatives.

==Concept and origins==
===Creation===
[[Matt Groening|Groening]] conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Brooks had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' series. However, when Groening realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a [[dysfunctional family]].<ref name=inter>{{cite interview |last=Groening |first=Matt |subject-link=Matt Groening |interviewer=David Bianculli |title=Fresh Air |publisher=[[NPR]] |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008 |location=Philadelphia |date=February 14, 2003 |access-date=August 8, 2007}}</ref> He named the characters after his own family members&nbsp;– his father Homer, his mother Margaret, and his younger sisters Lisa and Maggie. He substituted "Bart", an [[anagram]] of "brat", for his own name,<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video |people=BBC |year=2000 |title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6-minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |medium=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and modeled the character after his older brother, Mark.<ref name="mark">{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Paul |title=Matt Groening |type=Interview |work=Flux Magazine |issue=6 |date=September 30, 1999}}</ref><ref>Groening, Matt.

The five family members were given simple designs so that their facial emotions could easily be changed with almost no effort<ref name="138th">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |year=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode 'Fear of Flying' |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.<ref>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mike Reiss |year=2001 |title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "There's No Disgrace Like Home" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> The Simpson family made their debut on April 19, 1987, in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]".{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14}} In 1989, the shorts were adapted into ''The Simpsons'', a half-hour series airing on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |title=3rd Degree: Harry Shearer |access-date=September 21, 2008 |author=Kuipers, Dean |date=April 15, 2004 |publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605005153/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&IssueNum=32 |archive-date=June 5, 2008}}</ref>

===Casting===
[[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], and [[Yeardley Smith]] all began voicing their characters on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Nancy Cartwright was the only one of the group who had been trained to be a voice actor{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=21}} while Castellaneta had done some voice over work in Chicago. Castellaneta and Kavner had been part of the regular cast of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' and voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask them to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors.<ref name="The Age">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html |title=D'oh, you're the voices |access-date=February 7, 2008 |date=February 27, 2003 |first=Luaine |last=Lee |newspaper=[[The Age]]  |location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref name="FN"/> The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Yeardley Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director [[Bonita Pietila]] believed her voice was too high.

==The Simpson family==
The Simpsons are a family who live at [[The Simpsons house|742 Evergreen Terrace]] in the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] in the United States. The [[U.S. state|state]] in which this town is located is never specified, the mystery a [[Running gag|reoccurring joke]]; however, they do have snow and sometimes wear sweaters in the fall.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=28}} Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], a position at odds with his careless, [[jester|buffoon]]ish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] American [[Homemaking|housewife]] and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, an eight-year-old [[child prodigy]]; and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], a toddler who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a [[pacifier]]. The family owns a dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], and a cat, Snowball ll. Both pets have had starring roles in several seasons. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons [[floating timeline|do not physically age]] and still appear as they did at the end of the 1980s. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.<ref>{{cite video |people=Oakley, Bill |year=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Homer Simpson===
{{main|Homer Simpson}}
'''Homer Jay Simpson''' (voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]) is the protagonist of the show and the father of the Simpson family. He embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, thoughtless and a borderline alcoholic.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=78}} He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the situation calls for it, and an integrity reflecting his own values, including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family. His voice started out as an impression of [[Walter Matthau]] but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions.<ref name="FN">{{cite news |url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/doh-the-voice-of-homer-is-deceivingly-deadpan |title=D'oh!: The Voice of Homer Is Deceivingly Deadpan |access-date=February 7, 2008 |date=August 18, 2007 |author=Lynn Elber |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703090128/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C129665%2C00.html |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Homer has since become one of the most influential fictional characters and has been described by the British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' as the greatest comedic creation of modern time.<ref>{{cite news |title=There's nobody like him... except you, me, everyone |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=July 8, 2007 |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2042236.ece |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080515211629/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article2042236.ece |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 15, 2008 |access-date=July 20, 2007 |location=London}}</ref> He has inspired an entire line of merchandise, and his catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", has been included in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1387335.stm |title=It's in the dictionary, d'oh! |access-date=February 7, 2008 |date=June 14, 2001 |work=BBC News, Entertainment |publisher=BBC |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021203092605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1387335.stm |archive-date=December 3, 2002}}</ref> During the production of the episode "[[Insane Clown Poppy]]" the writers toyed with the idea of giving Homer a long lost illegitimate biological daughter, but when the show's [[showrunner]] and writer [[Mike Scully]], as well as Groening rejected the idea, the writers changed the story to [[Krusty the Clown]] having one instead.

===Marge Simpson===
{{main|Marge Simpson}}
'''Marjorie Bouvier "Marge" Simpson''' (née '''Bouvier''', voiced by [[Julie Kavner]]) is the well-meaning and extremely patient wife of Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie. She often acts as the voice of reason, but displays exaggerated behavior traits of [[Soccer mom|stereotypical middle-class mothers]] and takes the blatant dysfunctionality of her family for granted,{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=235}} unlike the other family members, who are aware that they are eccentric. Her most notable physical feature is her [[blue hair]], styled into an improbably high [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]].

===Bart Simpson===
{{main|Bart Simpson}}
'''Bartholomew Jo-Jo "Bart" Simpson''' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) is the eldest child and only son in the family, at age 10. Bart's most prominent character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness, disrespect for authority, and sharp wit.

When she was a baby, Bart started out not liking her, although he became nicer to her after Marge pointed out that Lisa loves him. Her first word was "Bart", with Bart happily teaching her more names. Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, the first one being "[[Moaning Lisa (The Simpsons)|Moaning Lisa]]". The idea for the episode was pitched by [[James L.

'''Margaret Lenny "Maggie" Simpson''' is the youngest of the five main family members and is almost always seen as an infant. She has blonde spiked hair like Lisa. Her first word was "daddy", shown at one point after Homer tucks her in. She is almost 2 years old and still uses a pacifier despite teething, although this was mentioned in a Treehouse of Horror episode ("Starship Poopers") and is not considered canon. She was quite prominent in the ''Tracey Ullman Show'' shorts, often being featured alongside [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] but has since become the least seen and heard of the five main Simpsons. It has been hinted that Maggie has outstanding artistic and academic abilities, much like her sister Lisa; episodes taking place in the future often show her as some kind of businesswoman.<ref name="EW">[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311750,00.html Face to Face: Maggie Simpson] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914030648/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C311750%2C00.html |date=September 14, 2008 }} ''Entertainment Weekly''.

'''Abraham Jay "Abe" Simpson II''' (better known simply as '''Grampa''', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]) is the [[patriarch]] of the Simpson family. He is the father of Homer, the father-in-law of Marge, the grandfather of Lisa, Bart and Maggie and the great grandfather of Bart Simpson, Jr and Skippy Simpson. He is a [[World War II]] veteran who was later sent to the Springfield Retirement Castle by Homer. He is known for his borderline [[Dementia|senility]], his long rambling (and probably apocryphal) stories and his love of ''[[Matlock (1986 TV series)|Matlock]]''. Unlike other members of the family, Groening says he refused to name him, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, the writers chose the name Abraham, the name of one of Groening's grandfathers.<ref name="oldmoney">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |year=2002 |title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode 'Old Money'.}}</ref>

===Mona Simpson===
'''Mona Penelope Simpson''' (née '''Olsen''', voiced by [[Glenn Close]]) is Homer's long-lost mother, Marge's mother-in-law, and Abe's estranged first wife. Her first major appearance was in "[[Mother Simpson]]" where she reveals that she was forced to abandon her family after being caught up in the [[hippie|hippie movement]] and participated in various acts of activism.

===Extended Simpson family===
* '''Herbert Walter "Herb" Powell''' {{anchor|Herbert Powell}}(voiced by [[Danny DeVito]]) – As his paternal half-brother, Herb resembles Homer, though he is much thinner, boasts a full head of hair and is more astute. He first appeared in the [[The Simpsons season 2|season two]] episode "[[Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?]]" when Homer is informed by his father Abe, after the latter suffered a mild heart attack, that he had a half-brother, the product of a short-lived affair between Abe and Gaby. A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived. Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and Mililani Powell, put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb is an exception to 'the Simpson gene', which causes all male members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they mature, as Herb is intelligent, successful and an astute businessman. Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of average Americans, to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejected Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? |episode-link=Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=February 21, 1991 |season=2 |number=28}}</ref> The episode was written by [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] but the idea of having Herb voiced by [[Danny DeVito]] had been pitched by [[Sam Simon]].<ref name="OhBrother">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Martin, Jeff; Reiss, Mike |year=2002 |title=The Simpsons The Complete second Season DVD commentary for the episode "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Due to some upsetting with the tragic ending of the episode, the producers decided to make a sequel.<ref name="TwoDimes">{{cite video |people=Brooks, James L.; Cartwright, Nancy; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Moore, Rich |year=2003 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Third Season DVD commentary for the episode "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Herb re-appeared [[The Simpsons season 3|the next season]] in "[[Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?]]". Now broke and homeless, he briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2000, which he used to build an invention that translated [[infant]]ile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new [[Product (business)|product]] and regained his fortune.

* '''Hugo Simpson''' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) – Hugo is Bart's conjoined twin from the "[[Treehouse of Horror VII]]" segment "The Thing and I". He and Bart were separated as babies by Dr. Hibbert and was deemed "evil". To hide the secret, Marge and Homer chained Hugo in the attic and fed him fish heads once a week. Later, Bart goes up to the attic and Hugo escapes, wanting to sew him and Bart back together. Dr. Hibbert managed to catch Hugo, but notices that the surgical scar is on the wrong side, meaning Bart is the evil twin. As a result, Hugo is released while Bart is chained in the attic. Hugo resembles Bart, but with ratty clothes, messy hair, and malformed teeth. Since he is a ''[[Treehouse of Horror]]'' character, he does not exist in the main episode continuity.

They work at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], and possess a strong dislike for their brother-in-law, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. Selma is the elder by two minutes, possesses a strong desire for family, and has been married and divorced six times, and also sought to have a child on numerous occasions despite her age.

===Jacqueline Bouvier===
'''Jacqueline Ingrid Bouvier''' (née '''Gurney''', voiced by [[Julie Kavner]]{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}}) is the mother of Marge, Patty and Selma, the maternal grandmother of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, the mother-in-law of Homer, the daughter-in-law of Pepe and Bambi Bouvier, the sister-in-law of Herman, Charlene, Jojo, Chester, and Arthur Bouvier, and the widow of Clancy Bouvier.

[[Mr. Burns]] and Homer's father [[Abraham Simpson|Abe Simpson]] once battled for her affections; she became engaged to Burns, but eventually decided not to marry either man,<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lady Bouvier's Lover |episode-link=Lady Bouvier's Lover |series=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Archer, Wes |network=[[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)]]Fox |airdate=May 12, 1994 |season=05 |number=21}}</ref> although she and Abe still ran away together at the end of the episode.

Although it seems that she disapproves of Marge's marriage to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], stating that he is never to address her as "Mom",<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episode-link=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jeffrey Lynch|Lynch, Jeffrey]] |network=Fox |airdate=December 26, 1991 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> she does tolerate Homer much more than her elder daughters, Patty and Selma. In "[[Moe Letter Blues]]", she admits that Patty and Selma are really to blame for ruining her birthday party, not Homer; also Jacqueline never has been shown to cause trouble in Homer and Marge's marriage, unlike her daughters. Jacqueline has celebrated her 80th birthday twice, in "[[Moe Letter Blues]]" and again in "[[Puffless]]".

Like all Bouvier women, she is voiced by Kavner, and has large, unique hair, resembling Marge's, only a light gray color due to her old age. In her younger days she smoked heavily but has quit, although she still [[laryngitis|speaks]] more raspily than Patty and Selma. The series creator [[Matt Groening]] named the character after the former American [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], whose maiden name was Bouvier. Out of all the characters on the show, Jacqueline has the tallest hair.

===Clancy Bouvier===
'''Clarence "Clancy" Bouvier''' (voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}}) is the deceased father of Marge, Patty and Selma and the husband of Jacqueline Bouvier. His first appearance was in the episode "[[The Way We Was]]".<ref name=WayWeWas>{{cite episode |title=The Way We Was |episode-link=The Way We Was |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Sam Simon|Simon, Sam]]; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=January 31, 1991 |season=02 |number=12}}</ref> He was kind and complimentary to teenage Homer when he arrived to pick up Marge for the [[prom]], but after finding out that [[Artie Ziff]] was really her date remarked that Homer "took years off my life". This provoked Marge to go back and go out with Homer.

In [[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|"Fear of Flying"]] it was revealed that he was one of the earliest male [[flight attendant]]s; Marge initially believed he was a heroic pilot and was traumatized when she discovered he was a flight attendant instead. According to Marge in "[[Bart the Lover]]" after Clancy got out of the Navy, he had trouble with his [[profanity|cursing]] that nearly cost him a job as a baby photographer, but Jacqueline was able to curtail that by having him donate money to the [[swear jar]].

In the episode "[[Puffless]]", it is revealed that he died of lung cancer,<ref>{{cite episode |title=Puffless |episode-link=Puffless |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Oliver, Rob; Burns, J Stewart |network=Fox |airdate=October 11, 2015 |season=27 |number=03}}</ref> which provoked Patty and Selma to abstain from smoking cigarettes. While Clancy does not appear with the rest of the Bouvier family in "[[I Married Marge]]", implying he was deceased before Homer and Marge were married, he is shown to be still alive when Bart and Lisa were toddlers in the episode "[[Walking Big & Tall]]",<ref>{{cite episode |title=Walking Big & Tall|episode-link=Walking Big & Tall |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Clements, Chris; Price, Michael |network=Fox |airdate=February 8, 2015 |season=26 |number=13}}</ref> but he died before Maggie was born. Marge was particularly upset by her father's death, as Homer had to buy her a [[white noise machine]] to try and get her to deal with it. In "[[Homer's Adventures Through the Windshield Glass]]", it is revealed that Clancy left Marge an inheritance in which she would be paid $1,000 per month. This was because he did not trust Homer to provide for her. When he died, Clancy went to [[Hell]] for a check forging scheme.

In "[[Treehouse of Horror III]]", he was eaten at King Homer and Marge's wedding by the former. He also appeared as a ghost in "[[Treehouse of Horror XXVI]]".

Like all the Bouvier family, his voice has become croaky through chain-smoking for a number of years. He also shares the same grunt as [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Patty and Selma]], both of whom resemble younger female versions of him, while Marge more resembles her mother.

=== Ling Bouvier ===
{{further|List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Ling Bouvier}}
'''Ling Bouvier'''{{anchor|Ling Bouvier}} (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) is Selma Bouvier's adopted daughter. She shares Selma's laugh. In "[[Goo Goo Gai Pan]]", Selma discovers that she has reached [[menopause]] and adopts Ling in China, after lying that she is married to Homer, to fool the Chinese authorities into thinking that Ling would be part of a traditional family as opposed to being raised by a single mother. The authorities briefly reclaim Ling, but the adoption agent Ms. Woo relates to her experiences of her childhood with her single mother and allows Selma to adopt Ling.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Goo Goo Gai Pan |episode-link=Goo Goo Gai Pan |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Talbot, Lawrence; Kramer, Lance |network=Fox |airdate=March 15, 2005 |season=16 |number=16}}</ref> Ling has since become a recurring character and has appeared in several episodes.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Simpsons Flashback: "Goo Goo Gai Pan" Review |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/911/911926p1.html |author=Canning, Robert |website=IGN |date=2008-09-22 |access-date=December 3, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925050803/http://tv.ign.com/articles/911/911926p1.html |archive-date=2008-09-25}}</ref> She seems to get along well with her cousin Maggie.

===Selma's husbands===
Selma has married six times, resulting in the lengthy last name Bouvier-Terwilliger-Hutz-McClure-Stu-Simpson-D'Amico.

* '''[[Sideshow Bob|"Sideshow Bob" Terwilliger]]''' (voiced by [[Kelsey Grammer]]) – Sideshow Bob meets Selma via a prison [[pen pal]] program in the [[The Simpsons season 3|season three]] episode "[[Black Widower]]".

* '''[[Lionel Hutz]]''' (voiced by [[Phil Hartman]]) – Lionel Hutz is mentioned as Selma's ex-husband in between Terwilliger and McClure in the [[The Simpsons season 7|season seven]] episode "[[Much Apu About Nothing]]".

For a while, she attempts to go along with the ruse, if only for the [[creature comforts]] she can access. When Troy says they need to have a child to divert public attention from rumors of his [[fetishism|fetish]] involving [[aquarium]] fish, Selma knows this is a line she will not cross, and they divorce.
* '''[[Disco Stu]]''' (voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]) – Disco Stu is referenced as Selma's ex-husband in the [[The Simpsons season 16|season sixteen]] episode "[[There's Something About Marrying]]".

==Pets==
===Dogs===
* '''[[Santa's Little Helper]]''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]<ref name=p117>[[#McCann|McCann]], pp. 117–118</ref> and [[Dan Castellaneta]]{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}}) – Santa's Little Helper is the Simpsons' pet [[greyhound]]. He first appeared in "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]" as a race dog adopted by Homer and Bart and has been in the series since.<ref name=p117/> While usually well-behaved, he can be vicious at times, having a female dog giving birth to 25 puppies which angers Bart at first, although Bart loves and cares for him deeply.
:*'''She Biscuit''': Santa's Little Helper's mother, who was separated from him when he was a puppy by their owner Les Moore. In the episode "[[The Way of the Dog]]", the Simpsons track down Moore and Santa's Little Helper and She Biscuit are reunited.
:*'''Puppies''': Santa's Little Helper is the father of numerous puppies, including 25 with She's the Fastest in "[[Two Dozen and One Greyhounds]]" and at least one other litter with [[Dr. Hibbert]]'s [[poodle]] Rosa Barks in "[[Today I Am A Clown]]".

* '''Laddie''' – A collie owned by the Simpson family in the episode "[[The Canine Mutiny]]". He joined the family after Bart managed to get a credit card issued to Santos L.

Described in the catalogue as the ultimate dog, Laddie was able to perform household chores and use the toilet.  Laddie resides with the Springfield Police Department after he incidentally sniffed out marijuana at a blind man's house and Bart gave up ownership.
*'''She's The Fastest''' - A female racing greyhound who Santa's Little Helper mated with in the episode "[[Two Dozen and One Greyhounds]]". Her owner, the [[Rich Texan]], gave her to the Simpsons since her bond to Santa's Little Helper meant she could no longer race, and she soon gave birth to a litter of 25 puppies.

===Cats===
{{anchor|Snowball II}}
* '''Snowball''' – Snowball (also known as '''Snowball I''') was the Simpson family's first [[List of fictional cats and other felines|cat]]. She was first mentioned in the [[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire|series premiere]] in a Christmas letter Marge is writing where she explains that Snowball died that year and went to "kitty heaven". Snowball was named due to her white fur. Snowball was, according to Lisa in a poem, run over by a [[Chrysler]] belonging to Mayor Quimby's brother "Clovis".<ref name=planetcat>{{cite book |title=Planet Cat: A CAT-alog |year=2007 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |isbn=9780618812592 |page=102 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shAHJQwXslYC&q=snowball+simpsons&pg=PA102}}</ref> She is seen during Bart's escalator ride to Heaven in the second-season episode "[[Bart Gets Hit by a Car]]" and in flashback in the ninth-season episode "[[Lisa's Sax]]". Bart unsuccessfully tries to revive her in "[[Treehouse of Horror III#Dial "Z" for Zombies|Dial Z for Zombies]]".
* '''Snowball II''' – (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]<ref name=p117/> and [[Dan Castellaneta]]{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |pp=178–179}}) Snowball II was the Simpson family's second cat. Although Snowball I had white fur, which inspired her name, Snowball II had black fur. She first appeared in the series premiere but has received little attention in the series. Snowball II and Santa's Little Helper have always been shown as having a good relationship; usually they are seen sleeping near each other. Snowball II's largest role is in the [[The Simpsons season 14|fourteenth season]] episode "[[Old Yeller Belly]]", in which she saves [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] from a burning treehouse. She also has minor roles in "[[Bart Gets an Elephant]]", where she tries to get attention; in "[[Two Dozen and One Greyhounds]]", in which she is scared by the many puppies; and in "[[Make Room for Lisa]]", in which Lisa has a [[hallucination]] where she becomes Snowball II.
:* In the episode "[[I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot]]", Snowball II is killed and is replaced in series by '''Snowball III''' and then '''Coltrane''' (a.k.a. '''Snowball IV'''), both of which also die quickly. A final replacement, '''Snowball V''' is essentially identical to Snowball II and proves to be less unlucky. Lisa renames this cat '''Snowball II''' and the events of this episode are never referred to again.<ref name=planetcat/> This cat is the focus of a subplot in the [[The Simpsons season 16|sixteenth season]] episode "[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]]", in which she becomes overweight after abandoning the Simpsons for brief periods to visit a different family but she then goes back to live with the Simpson family.<ref name=planetcat/>

At the end of the episode, Homer puts Pinchy in a hot bath, but accidentally boils and kills him. Since his body is cooked, a sobbing Homer eats Pinchy's remains, saying that "That's what he would want".
