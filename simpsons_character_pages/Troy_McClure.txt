'''Troy McClure''' is a fictional character in the American animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He was originally [[voice acting|voiced]] by [[Phil Hartman]] and first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|second season]] episode "[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]".<ref name=first>{{cite video | people=Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike|year=2002|title=The Simpsons The Complete Second Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> McClure is a washed-up actor who is usually shown doing low-level work, most notably hosting manipulative infomercials and questionable educational films. He appears as the main character in "[[A Fish Called Selma]]", in which he marries [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma Bouvier]] to aid his failing career and quash rumors about his personal life. McClure also hosts "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]" and "[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]".

McClure was partially based on B movie actors [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Doug McClure]], as well as Hartman himself. Following Hartman's murder on May 28, 1998, two of his ''Simpsons'' characters were retired, with Hartman's final speaking appearance as McClure occurring in the [[The Simpsons (season 10)|tenth season]] episode "[[Bart the Mother]]" four months after his murder. Since then, he has only occasionally cameoed in the background. Since his retirement, McClure has often been cited as one of the series' most popular characters. In 2006, ''[[IGN]]'' ranked McClure No. 1 on their list of the "Top 25 ''Simpsons'' Peripheral Characters".

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Troy McClure is a stereotypical [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] has-been.<ref name=fcs>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh; Oakley, Bill; Silverman, David; Goldblum, Jeff|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> He was a star in the early 1970s, but his career went downhill due to rumors of [[zoophilia]] involving fish. In most of his appearances in the show, he hosts short video clips that other characters watch on television or in a public place. He often presents educational videos<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Vegetarian|episode-link=Lisa the Vegetarian |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David; Kirkland, Mark; Mirkin, David|network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-15 |season=7 |number=133}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Simpson|episode-link=Lisa the Simpson |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Goldreyer, Ned; Dietter, Susie; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1998-03-08 |season=9 |number=195}}</ref> and [[infomercial]]s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Marge in Chains|episode-link=Marge in Chains |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-06 |season=4 |number=80}}</ref> They are often low-quality, highly erroneous and too short and incomplete to be useful, and feature bizarre topics such as ''Dig Your Own Grave and Save'' and ''Smoke Yourself Thin''.  McClure introduces himself by saying, "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such [films, educational videos, voiceovers, etc.] as...," mentioning two titles that are similar to his current performance. For example, in the episode "[[Bart the Mother]]", McClure introduces a film about birds by saying, "Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as ''Earwigs: Eww!'' and ''Man vs. Nature: The Road to Victory''."<ref>{{cite episode|title=Bart the Mother|episode-link=Bart the Mother|series=The Simpsons|series-link=The Simpsons|credits=Cohen, David S.; Moore, Steven Dean; Scully, Mike|network=Fox|airdate=1998-09-27|season=10|number=206}}</ref> When he auditions to voice the character Poochie in "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show" (a role he would lose to Homer Simpson), he falls into his introductory style, mentioning his previous role as Christmas Ape.

McClure's most prominent role occurs in the seventh-season episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]".<ref name="BBC">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page18.shtml |title=A Fish Called Selma |access-date=2007-05-09 |author =Martyn, Warren |author2 =Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223211431/https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page18.shtml|archive-date=2003-12-23}}</ref> In the episode, McClure begins a relationship with [[Selma Bouvier]], whom he meets when she gives him an eye test at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] and agrees to go out on a date as a condition for passing him. The relationship revives his career, leading him to star in ''Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!'', a stage musical version of the film ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. To further boost McClure's career, McClure's agent suggests that he get married. Unaware of McClure's motivation, Selma accepts his proposal, and moves into McClure's house, a [[Modern architecture|Modernist]] building which resembles the [[Chemosphere]]. At his [[bachelor party]], a drunken McClure tells [[Homer Simpson]] that the marriage is just a sham to help his career. Homer says nothing at the wedding, but later offhandedly mentions McClure's admission to [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], who then informs her sister. Selma decides to remain with McClure anyway, but she becomes disturbed when McClure's agent advises the pair to have a child (since "all the big parts these days are going to family men"). Having a child will secure McClure's casting as McBain's sidekick in ''McBain IV: Fatal Discharge'', but Selma is unwilling to bring a child into a loveless relationship and decides to leave McClure. McClure ultimately gets the role, but turns it down in order to direct and star in his own pet project, a [[20th Century Fox]] film called ''The Contrabulous Fabtraption of Professor Horatio Hufnagel''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Fish Called Selma |episode-link=A Fish Called Selma |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Barth, Jack; Kirkland, Mark; Weinstein, Josh; Oakley, Bill|network=Fox |airdate=1996-03-24 |season=7 |number=147}}</ref>

In addition to his in-story appearances, McClure appears as host of "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]" and "[[The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase]]". The first is a behind-the-scenes look at ''The Simpsons'', answering questions and featuring extra "never-before-seen" material.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular|episode-link=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, John; Silverman, David; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-03 |season=7 |number=138}}</ref> The second is an episode presenting three possible spin-offs from ''The Simpsons''.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase|episode-link=The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David; Greaney, Dan; Tompkins, Steve; Affleck, Neil; Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh|network=Fox |airdate=1995-12-03 |season=7 |number=138}}</ref>

===In other media===
McClure was made into an action figure as part of the ''[[World of Springfield]]'' toy line, and was released in the "Celebrity Series 1" wave in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonscollectors.com/wospdb/figure.asp?fig=f0075|title=Troy McClure|access-date=June 8, 2007|publisher=Simpsons Collectors|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020901080937/http://simpsonscollectors.com/wospdb/figure.asp?fig=F0075|archive-date=September 1, 2002}}</ref> He also features briefly in the video game ''[[Virtual Springfield]]'', introducing the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] to the player.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.7/2.7pages/2.7toledosimpsons.html|date=October 1997|title=Mmmmmm...A Virtual Travel Guide: Virtual Springfield |author=Joe Toledo|access-date=June 9, 2007|publisher=Animation World Network}}</ref>

==Character==

===Creation===
[[File:Phil as Chick-1-1.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Phil Hartman]] voiced Troy McClure]]
McClure was based on the typical "washed up" Hollywood actor. [[B movie]] actors [[Troy Donahue]] and [[Doug McClure]] served as inspiration for his name and certain character aspects.<ref name=first/><ref name=inter>{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subject-link = Matt Groening| interviewer = [[Terry Gross]]| title = Fresh Air| publisher = [[NPR]]| work = [[WHYY-FM]]| url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4249835| location = Philadelphia| date = December 29, 2004| access-date = June 9, 2007}}</ref><ref name="sprcon">{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |last2=Klickstein |first2=Mathew |title=Springfield confidential: jokes, secrets, and outright lies from a lifetime writing for the Simpsons |date=2018 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0062748034 |page=100|location=New York City}}</ref> Doug McClure found the homage funny and his children called him "Troy McClure" when his back was turned.<ref name=first/><ref name="sprcon"/> According to show creator [[Matt Groening]], [[Phil Hartman]] was cast in the role due to his ability to pull "the maximum amount of humor" out of any line he was given.<ref name=inter/> McClure's visual appearance is similar to that of Hartman himself.<ref>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> When he was designed, McClure was given an extra line under his eyes to suggest that the character had gotten a [[facelift]].<ref>Bird, Brad. (2003). Commentary for "Homer Alone", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

In a very brief appearance in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season 2]] episode "[[Bart's Dog Gets an "F"]]{{-"}}, Troy was voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]].<ref>{{cite video|people=Jean, Al|year=2002|title=The Simpsons The Complete Second Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Bart's Dog Gets an "F"]]{{-"}}|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

===Development===
According to executive producer [[Al Jean]], the writers often used McClure as a "panic button" and added the character when they felt an episode needed more humor.<ref name="Jean">Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for "Homer Alone", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

McClure's character is most developed in "A Fish Called Selma", which provides a more in-depth look into his private life and backstory.<ref name=fcs/> [[Showrunner]]s [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] were fans of Hartman, and wished to make an episode entirely about McClure in order to give Hartman as much to do as possible. From this came the idea of McClure's marriage to [[Selma Bouvier]], as she was "always marrying people".<ref name=fcs/> Animator [[Mark Kirkland]] was particularly pleased that McClure was the star of the episode. He enjoyed interpreting Hartman's voice-over performances, and the episode allowed him and the other animators to "open [McClure] up visually as a character".<ref name=fcs/>

Throughout "A Fish Called Selma", it is hinted that McClure engages in strange sexual behavior. The writers did not initially know what the "unsavory" sexual preference would be, but eventually decided on a fish fetish, using a suggestion from executive producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Josh Weinstein described the fish fetish concept as "so perverted and strange, it was over the top."<ref name=fcs/>

===Retirement===
Phil Hartman was murdered in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9805/28/hartman/|title=Phil Hartman, wife die in apparent murder-suicide|access-date=June 8, 2007|date=May 28, 1998|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> Rather than re-casting the role with a new voice actor, the production staff retired McClure, along with Hartman's other recurring character, [[Lionel Hutz]].<ref name=inter/> McClure last appeared in the season ten episode "[[Bart the Mother]]", which was dedicated to Hartman.<ref name="finalep">{{cite news|title=Tributes to a Star And His Voices|date=September 23, 1998|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|first=Virginia|last=Rohan|page=Y8}}</ref> Before his death, Hartman had often expressed an interest in starring in a live-action film about McClure, which would be penned by some of the show's writers.<ref>{{cite video|people=Oakley, Bill|year=2006|title=The Simpsons The Complete Seventh Season DVD commentary for the episode "[[Homerpalooza]]"|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> He noted that he was "looking forward to his live-action movie, publicizing [McClure's] [[Betty Ford Center|Betty Ford]] appearances."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/H/Hartman_Phil/1996/12/01/758979.html|title=Phil: The Jerky Guy|access-date=August 4, 2008|date=December 1, 1996|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|Canoe]]|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711225150/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/H/Hartman_Phil/1996/12/01/758979.html|archive-date=July 11, 2012}}</ref> [[Matt Groening]] later told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' that the idea never "got further than enthusiasm", but "would have been really fun".<ref name="empire">{{cite news | first = Olly | last = Richards | title = Life in Development Hell | page = 76 | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = May 24, 2007}}</ref> Although retired from speaking roles, the character has still appeared in background roles in subsequent episodes,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/the-simpsons-gets-pointlessly-medieval-all-over-its-sea-1819040310|title=The Simpsons gets pointlessly medieval all over its season 29 premiere|publisher=AV Club|accessdate=2022-04-15|date=2017-01-10|author=Perkins, Dennis}}</ref> and is also featured on the Digital Purchase cover for [[The Simpsons (season 30)|season 30]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/simpsons-season-30-troy-mcclure-marketing/#:~:text=The%20character%20on%20The%20Simpsons,Phil%20Hartman's%20death%20in%201998.&text=The%20Simpsons%20season%2030%20is,of%20voice%20actor%20Phil%20Hartman.|title=Simpsons Season 30 Is Marketing Itself In Bad Taste With Troy McClure|accessdate=2022-04-15|publisher=ScreenRant|date=2018-11-29|author=Leadbeater, Alex}}</ref>

==Reception and cultural influence==
Even after his retirement, McClure remains a popular supporting character. ''[[IGN]]'' ranked McClure first in their 2006 list of the "Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters", calling him "a wonderfully bizarre and entertaining character that showcases the best of what small roles on The Simpsons can be."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/02/16/the-simpsons-top-25-peripheral-characters?page=3|title=Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters|access-date=March 6, 2015|date=February 16, 2012|author1=Eric Goldman |author2=Dan Iverson |author3=Brian Zoromski |website=IGN}}</ref> In a 2007 article on ''Simpsons'' guest stars, Adam Finley of [[TV Squad]] wrote that McClure was "responsible for some of the funniest moments in ''Simpsons'' history."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/20/the-five-great-simpsons-guest-stars/|title=The Five: Great Simpsons guest stars|author=Adam Finley|date=June 20, 2006|publisher=TV Squad|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108051237/http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/06/20/the-five-great-simpsons-guest-stars/|archive-date=November 8, 2006|access-date=June 23, 2007}}</ref> Hartman ranked first on [[AOL]]'s list of their favorite 25 ''Simpsons'' guest stars.<ref>{{cite web|author=Potts, Kimberly|title=Favorite 'Simpsons' Guest Stars|url=http://television.aol.com/feature/the-simpsons/guest-stars|access-date=November 24, 2008|publisher=[[AOL]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515205009/http://television.aol.com/feature/the-simpsons/guest-stars|archive-date=May 15, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] argues in ''[[Planet Simpson]]'' that McClure and [[Lionel Hutz]] "together ... represent the most significant contribution to the show outside of its permanent cast," adding that "the show's Golden Age is hard to imagine without them."{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=405–406}} He continues, "The smarmy Hollywood type ... has been done to death, but Hartman's version breathed new life into it with each appearance. McClure has become the [[apotheosis]] of the stereotype, a gut-achingly funny reinterpretation whose trademark introduction ... has become a shorthand way to describe any grossly artificial media figure."{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=405–406}}

McClure's most prominent episode, "[[A Fish Called Selma]]", is a favorite of many staff members,<ref name=fcs/> and has been cited as one of the series' best episodes by several publications. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' placed the episode eighth on their top 25 ''The Simpsons'' episode list,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,417748_2,00.html|title=The Family Dynamic|access-date=June 9, 2007|date=January 29, 2003|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|archive-date=May 10, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510032159/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C417748_2%2C00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> and ''IGN'' named the episode the best of the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh season]], calling it the "obvious pick". They also deemed McClure's ''Planet of the Apes'' musical the best moment of the episode and "maybe even the whole show".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/08/the-simpsons-20-seasons-20-episodes|title=The Simpsons: 17 Seasons, 17 Episodes|author1=Goldman, Eric |author2=Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski |website=IGN|date=September 8, 2006|access-date=June 9, 2007}}</ref>

McClure was one of Hartman's best-known roles. He often used his McClure voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of ''[[NewsRadio]]''. He remarked, "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans."<ref>{{cite news|title=Out of the Bottle&nbsp;– Along With Many Amusing Characters, Phil Hartman of 'Newsradio' Unleashes the Rare Exception|date=February 24, 1998|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|page=Y–01|author=Virginia Rohan}}</ref> He added "It's the one thing that I do in my life that's almost an avocation.

The title of a song on American indie-rock band [[Yo La Tengo]]'s ninth full-length album, ''[[And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out]]'', "Let's Save Tony Orlando's House", is based upon a telethon that McClure hosts in the episode "[[Marge on the Lam]]". In an interview with the [[A.V.
