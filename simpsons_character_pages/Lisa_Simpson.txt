'''Lisa Marie Simpson'''<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa's Wedding |episode-link=Lisa's Wedding |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=Fox |airdate=1995-03-19 |season=6 |number=19 |time=10:08}}</ref> is one of the main characters in the animated television sitcom series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. She is the middle child of the [[Simpson family]]. Voiced by [[Yeardley Smith]], Lisa was born as a character in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] created and designed her while waiting to meet [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic ''[[Life in Hell]]'', but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the older Simpson daughter after his younger sister Lisa Groening Bartlett. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three years, the Simpson family were moved to their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted on December 17, 1989. Lisa has appeared in every episode of ''The Simpsons'' except for "[[Carl Carlson Rides Again]]".

Intelligent, kind, and passionate about the planet and all living things, Lisa Simpson is the second child of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]. She is the younger sister of [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], and the older sister of [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. At age 8, Lisa's high intellect and [[American Left|left-wing political stance]] creates a barrier between her and other children her age.  She is a loner and a social outcast. Lisa is a [[Veganism|vegan]], a [[bibliophile]], a strong [[environmentalist]], a [[feminist]], and a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]]. Lisa's character develops many times over the course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season 7]], converts to Buddhism in [[The Simpsons (season 13)|season 13]], and becomes a vegan in [[The Simpsons (season 32)|season 32]]. A strong liberal and activist for peace, equality, and the environment, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes (e.g. standing against apartheid in South Africa and supporting the [[Tibetan independence movement]]) which sets her against most of the people in Springfield. However, she can also be somewhat intolerant of opinions that differ from her own, often refusing to consider alternative perspectives and showing a feeling of [[self-righteousness]]. In her free time, Lisa enjoys many hobbies such as reading and playing the [[baritone saxophone]]. She has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''—including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials and comic books—and inspired a line of merchandise.

Yeardley Smith originally tried out for the role of Bart, while [[Nancy Cartwright]] (who was later cast as the voice for Bart) tried out for Lisa. Producers considered Smith's voice too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. In the ''Tracey Ullman Show'' shorts, Lisa was something of a "female Bart" who mirrored her brother's mischief, but as the series progressed she became a liberal voice of reason which has drawn both praise and criticism from fans of the show. Because of her unusual pointed hairstyle, many animators consider Lisa the most difficult ''Simpsons'' character to draw.

''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked her 11th (tied with Bart) on their list of the "Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time". Her environmentalism has been especially well-received; several episodes featuring her have won [[Genesis Awards|Genesis]] and [[Environmental Media Awards]], including a special "board of directors Ongoing Commitment Award" in 2001. [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] included Lisa on their list of the "Most Animal-Friendly TV Characters of All Time". Yeardley Smith won a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992 and Lisa and her family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2000.

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters do not physically age. The show itself is perpetually set in the year of broadcast (except for occasional flashbacks and [[flashforward]]s). In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78–79}} Lisa's year of birth is given in "[[Lisa's First Word]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season 4]], 1992) as 1984, during [[1984 Summer Olympics|the Summer Olympics]].<ref name="FirstWord">{{cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word |episode-link=Lisa's First Word |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=October 24, 2021 |season=33 |number=5}}</ref> The episode "[[That '90s Show (The Simpsons)|That '90s Show]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]], 2008), however, contradicts much of the established backstory; for example, it presents Homer and Marge as being childless in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Simpsons: ''That '90s Show'' Review |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/847/847940p1.html |website=IGN |date=January 28, 2008 |author=Canning, Robert |access-date=May 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=That '90s Show |episode-link=That '90s Show (The Simpsons) |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Matt Selman|Selman, Matt]]; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]] |network=Fox |airdate=January 27, 2008 |season=19 |number=11}}</ref> Despite this, Lisa is portrayed as being 8 years old.{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=17}} Lisa is a lover of music, with [[jazz]] as her favorite genre; she specifically singles out [[Miles Davis]]'s 1957 album ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' as her favorite album.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Birth of the Cool|url=https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Birth_of_the_Cool|access-date=August 19, 2020|website=Wikisimpsons|language=en}}</ref> She enjoys and excels at playing the saxophone and became friends with jazz musician [[Bleeding Gums Murphy]], whom she regards as an idol.

==Character==
===Creation===
[[Matt Groening]] conceived Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' and had intended to present an adaptation of his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strip. When he realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening went in another direction,<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video |people=BBC |year=2000 |title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6-minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> hurriedly sketching his version of a [[dysfunctional family]], named after members of his own family. Lisa was named after Groening's younger sister, but little else was based on her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003818762_realsimpsons030.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525111318/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2003818762_realsimpsons030.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 25, 2012 |title=The real people behind Homer Simpson and family |author=Rose, Joseph |date=August 3, 2007 |website=[[The Oregonian]]}}</ref> In ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' shorts, Lisa displayed none of the intelligence for which she later became known. She was more of a "female Bart"<ref name=MirkinBSNTH/> and was originally described as simply the "middle child", without much personality.<ref name=Carty/>

Lisa made her brief debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]".{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14}} On December 17, 1989, the shorts were adapted into ''The Simpsons'', a half-hour series on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/>

===Design===
[[File:Lisasmall2.gif|right|frame|alt=Lisa's head is a quartered sphere with a horizontal axis, viewed obliquely from the side; three hair spikes emerge from each upper quarter and two emerge from the near lower quarter.|This image illustrates how to draw Lisa's head and hairline using the three-three-two arrangement]]

However, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline.<ref>Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002).

To draw Lisa's head and hair, most of the show's animators use what they call the "three-three-two arrangement". It begins with a circle, with two curving lines (one vertical, one horizontal) intersecting in the middle to indicate her eyeline. The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point, with two more added towards the back of her head. Three more points are then added in front (in the direction Lisa is facing), with two more behind it.<ref>Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005).

Smith and the show's writers worked to give Lisa a more defined personality, and she has developed greatly during the series. In her 2000 memoir ''[[My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy]]'', Cartwright wrote: "with the brilliant wit of the writers and the wry, in-your-eye, honest-to-a-fault interpretation, Yeardley Smith has made Lisa a bright light of leadership, full of compassion and competence beyond her years. Lisa Simpson is the kind of child we not only want our children to be but also the kind of child we want ''all'' children to be. But, at the time, on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', she was just an animated eight-year-old kid who had no personality."<ref name=Carty/>

Despite Lisa's fame, Smith is rarely recognized in public, which she does not mind.

"If I had to be associated with one character in fiction," she said, "I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson."<ref name="Happy"/> Matt Groening has described Smith as being very similar to Lisa: "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character.

In ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' shorts, Lisa was something of a "female Bart": equally mischievous but lacking unique traits.<ref name=MirkinBSNTH>Mirkin, David. (2004).

Commentary for "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature, such as "Moaning Lisa" (season one, 1990). The idea for the episode was pitched by [[James L. Brooks]], who wanted to do an emotional episode involving Lisa's sadness, to complement the many "jokey episodes" in the first season.<ref name="Reiss1">Reiss, Mike. (2001). Commentary for "[[Moaning Lisa (The Simpsons)|Moaning Lisa]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

In the seventh-season episode "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]" (1995), Lisa permanently becomes a vegetarian, distinguishing her as one of the first primetime television characters to make such a choice.<ref name="PETA"/> The episode was written by David S. Cohen (in his first solo writing credit), who jotted down the idea one day while eating lunch. Then-executive producer [[David Mirkin]], who had recently become a vegetarian himself, quickly approved the idea. Several of Lisa's experiences in the episode are based on Mirkin's own experiences. The episode guest stars musician [[Paul McCartney]], a committed vegetarian and animal rights activist. McCartney's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian and would not revert the next week (as is common on situation comedies). The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show.<ref>Cohen, David S.; Groening, Matt; Mirkin, David. (2005).

Lisa plays the [[baritone saxophone]], and some episodes use that as a plot device. According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show."<ref name="Saxophone"/> One of the hallmarks of the show's [[The Simpsons opening sequence|opening sequence]] is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class. ''The Simpsons'' composer [[Alf Clausen]] said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at the second-grade level and instead "think of Lisa as a really good player."<ref name="Sax and Single">{{cite magazine |title=Sax and the Single Simpson |last=Rhodes |first=Joe |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 26, 1991 |url=https://ew.com/article/1991/07/26/why-lisa-simpson-plays-blues/ |access-date=March 8, 2010 |archive-date=January 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109201759/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,314958,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Lisa is also a skilled multi-instrumentalist. In addition to the saxophone, she can also play guitar (as shown in "[[Last Exit to Springfield]]"), bass guitar (as shown in "[[Whacking Day]]"), and piano (as shown in "[[Miracle on Evergreen Terrace]]").

Lisa, despite being a [[child prodigy]], often sees herself as a misfit within the Simpson family and other children due to possessing an unusually high level of intelligence. She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield, including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways,{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=78}} and is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield,<ref>{{cite news |title=Eat my lab coat |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/oct/30/research.highereducation2 |work=The Guardian |date=October 30, 2003 |access-date=March 19, 2010 |author=Gross, Michael |location=London}}</ref> with her rebellion against social norms being depicted as constructive and heroic, yet she can be self-righteous at times.<ref>{{harvnb|Pinsky|2001 |p=46}}</ref> In "[[Lisa the Vegetarian]]", an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father's roast-pig barbecue, an act for which she later apologizes.

In the 1990s, it was considered odd to allow a girl to play football. However, when coach [[Ned Flanders]] reveals that several girls already play for the team, she hesitates and claims football is "not really [her] thing". She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig's skin, but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to [[Amnesty International]]. Upset by being unable to gain [[Self-righteousness|moral superiority]], Lisa runs off.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart Star |episode-link=Bart Star |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, David X.; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=November 9, 1997 |season=09 |number=06}}</ref>

Although she is wise beyond her years, Lisa has typical childhood issues, sometimes requiring adult intervention. One episode to show this is "[[See Homer Run]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 17)|season seventeen]], 2005) where she goes through a developmental condition which causes her to get into trouble at school.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=203}} In "[[Lost Our Lisa]]" (season nine, 1998), she tricks Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone, only to become hopelessly lost and in need of aid from her father.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lost Our Lisa |episode-link=Lost Our Lisa |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Brian Scully|Scully, Brian]]; Michels, Pete |network=Fox |airdate=May 10, 1998 |season=09 |number=24}}</ref> Chris Turner writes in ''Planet Simpson'' that incidents like this illustrate that "Even when Lisa's lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest, she never becomes a full-grown adult trapped in a child's body."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=203}} In ''[[The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer]]'', Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual, she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities, plays with Malibu Stacy dolls, loves ponies, obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as [[Brother from the Same Planet|Corey]], and watches ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]'' along with Bart. He writes, "One might argue that this is typical childhood behavior, but since in so many cases Lisa is presented not simply as a prodigy but as preternaturally wise, the fondness for ''Itchy & Scratchy'' and Corey seem to be highlighted, taking on greater significance. Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom, but then she also worships Corey so she's 'no better [than the rest of us]'."<ref>{{harvnb|Skoble|1999 |pp=31–32}}</ref> Lisa occasionally worries that her family's dull habits will rub off on her, such as in "[[Lisa the Simpson]]" (season nine, 1998) she worries that the "Simpson gene" will make her a dimwit later finding out the gene only goes through the male side.<ref>{{cite news |title=Men on TV: Dumb as Posts And Proud of It |date=April 9, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/arts/men-on-tv-dumb-as-posts-and-proud-of-it.html?pagewanted=3 |work=The New York Times |access-date=March 8, 2010 |author=Gates, Anita}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Simpson |episode-link=Lisa the Simpson |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Ned Goldreyer|Goldreyer, Ned]]; Dietter, Susie |network=Fox |airdate=March 8, 1998 |season=09 |number=17}}</ref>
 
She is also concerned that Maggie may grow up to be like the rest of the family and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in ''Planet Simpson'' that "Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit ... but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=233}} Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward "[[Lisa's Wedding]]" (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fiancé.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa's Wedding |episode-link=Lisa's Wedding |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Greg Daniels|Daniels, Greg]]; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=March 19, 1995 |season=06 |number=19}}</ref> In the episode "[[Mother Simpson]]" (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona Simpson]] for the first time.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Mother Simpson |episode-link=Mother Simpson |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Richard Appel|Appel, Rich]]; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=November 19, 1995 |season=07 |number=08}}</ref> Mona is also well-read and articulate, and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa's intelligence.<ref>Appel, Rich.

===Sexuality===
Lisa's sexuality has become the subject of speculation amongst viewers of the show. Lisa is shown to have [[heterosexual]] [[Limerence|crushes]] on Nelson Muntz and Langdon Alger in "[[Lisa's Date with Density]]" and "[[Bart on the Road]]" respectively. In some episodes Lisa is shown to have a boyfriend, such as Edmund Dracula in "[[Treehouse of Horror XXI]]" or Colin in "[[The Simpsons Movie]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://screenrant.com/simpsons-movie-colin-lisa-boyfriend-what-happened/|title=The Simpsons: What Happened To Lisa's Boyfriend Colin After The Movie?|last=Tyler|first=Adrienne|date=August 19, 2020|work=[[Screen Rant]]|access-date=October 28, 2020}}</ref> Lisa becomes engaged to, and later almost marries, Hugh Parkfield in "[[Lisa's Wedding]]" and the episode "[[Holidays of Future Passed]]" suggests that Lisa will go on to marry Milhouse Van Houten.

===Cultural influence===
Jonathan Gray, author of the book ''Watching The Simpsons'', feels that Lisa "is probably the best and certainly longest-running feminist character that television has had. She's the heart of the show and she quite often questions gender politics."<ref>{{harvnb|Ortved|2009 |p=86}}</ref> Christopher Borrelli of ''[[The Toledo Blade]]'' wrote, "Has there ever been a female TV character as complex, intelligent, and, ahem, as emotionally well-drawn as Lisa Simpson? Meet her once and she comes off priggish and one-note&nbsp;– a know-it-all. Get to know her and Lisa is as well-rounded as anyone you may ever meet in the real world."<ref>{{Cite news |title=She's not even real and she's a feminist role model liberated Lisa |work=[[Toledo Blade|The Toledo Blade]] |author=Borrelli, Christopher |date=March 11, 2001}}</ref>

Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and community struck a chord with Japanese audiences.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=327}} Mario D'Amato, a specialist in Buddhist studies at [[Rollins College]] in Florida, described Lisa as "open-minded, reflective, ethical, and interested in improving herself in various ways, while still preserving a childlike sense of innocence. These are all excellent qualities, ones which are espoused by many Buddhist traditions."<ref>{{harvnb|Pinsky|2007 |p=180}}</ref>
