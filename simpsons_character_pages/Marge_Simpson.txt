Voiced by [[Julie Kavner]],{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=1099}} she first appeared on television in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short "[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]" on April 19, 1987. Marge was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He based the character on his mother Margaret Groening. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three seasons, the Simpson family received their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.

Marge is the [[Matriarchy|matriarch]] and [[housewife]] of the Simpson family. With her husband [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], she has three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. Marge is the moralistic force in her family and often provides a grounding voice in the midst of her family's antics by trying to maintain order in the Simpson household. She cooks, cleans, and without her in the Simpson family, they would be in despair. She is often portrayed as a stereotypical television mother and is often included on lists of top "TV moms". She has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''—including [[List of The Simpsons video games|video games]], ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]], commercials, and [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]]—and inspired an entire line of merchandise.

Marge's distinctive blue [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive]] hairstyle was inspired by a combination of the Bride's in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, who was a member of the original cast of ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] in 1992. She was also nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in ''The Simpsons Movie''. In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] (the characters do not physically age), and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78–79}} Marge Simpson is married to [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=239–240}} She was raised by her parents, [[Jacqueline Bouvier (The Simpsons)|Jacqueline]] and [[Clancy Bouvier]].<ref name=WayWeWas>{{cite episode |title=The Way We Was |episode-link=The Way We Was |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Sam Simon|Simon, Sam]]; [[David Silverman (animator)|Silverman, David]] |network=Fox |airdate=January 31, 1991 |season=02 |number=12}}</ref> She has a pair of sisters, the joyless [[Patty and Selma]], both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer. In "[[The Way We Was]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]], 1991), it is revealed via flashback that Marge attended Springfield High School, and in her final year met Homer, after they both were sent to detention—Homer for smoking in the bathroom with Barney, and Marge for burning her bra in a feminist protest. She was at first wary of Homer, but agreed to go to the prom with him, although she ended up going with [[Artie Ziff]]  after Homer received tutoring lessons as a means to get to know her better, while knowing that she needed to sleep for a school meet. However, she regretted going with Artie when he started to pressure her to have sex after prom. At the end of the evening, while Artie drove her home after receiving a slap, she spied Homer walking along the side of the road with the corsage meant for her. After hearing her parents voicing their negative opinions about Homer, she took her own car and went back to give him a ride. She then told Homer she should've gone to the prom with him and he fixes her snapped shoulder strap with the corsage. During the ride, he tells her he will hug her and kiss her and never be able to let her go. After the two had been dating for several years, Marge discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and she and Homer were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line.<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episode-link=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jeffrey Lynch|Lynch, Jeffrey]] |network=Fox |airdate=December 26, 1991 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> Bart was born soon after, and the couple bought [[the Simpsons house|their first house]]. The episode "[[That '90s Show (The Simpsons)|That '90s Show]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]], 2008) contradicted much of the established back-story; for example, it was revealed that Marge and Homer were childless in the early 1990s although past episodes had suggested Bart and Lisa were born in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=That '90s Show |episode-link=That '90s Show (The Simpsons) |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Matt Selman|Selman, Matt]]; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]] |network=Fox |airdate=January 27, 2008 |season=19 |number=11}}</ref>

As with many ''Simpsons'' characters, Marge's age and birthday changes to serve the story.

==Character==

===Creation===
[[File:Matt Groening by Gage Skidmore -retouch.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Matt Groening created Marge while waiting in James L. Brooks' office. |alt=A man in glasses and a plaid shirt sits in front of a microphone.]]
[[Matt Groening]] first conceived Marge and the rest of the Simpson family in 1987 in the lobby of producer [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', and had intended to present an adaptation of his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strip. When he realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video |people=BBC |year=2000 |title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6-minute edit for the season 1 DVD) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |format=DVD |location=UK |publisher=20th Century Fox |access-date=July 1, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081722/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/ |archive-date=February 11, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and hurriedly sketched out his version of a [[dysfunctional family]], naming the characters after members of his own family.

Marge debuted with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]".{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=14}}{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=20}} In 1989, the shorts were adapted into ''The Simpsons'', a half-hour series airing on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]].

Matt Groening believes that episodes featuring Marge are among the most difficult episodes to write. [[Bill Oakley]] believes that the "junior" writers are usually given Marge episodes because he and writing partner [[Josh Weinstein]] were given several to write during their first season.<ref>Groening, Matt; Oakley, Bill. (2004). Commentary for "[[Marge in Chains]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> During the third season of the show, most of the writers focused on Bart and Homer, so [[David M. Stern]] decided to write a Marge episode, which became "[[Homer Alone]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]], 1992). He felt that they could achieve a "deeper vein" of comedy in an episode where Marge has a nervous breakdown, and James L. Brooks quickly approved.<ref>[[David M. Stern|Stern, David M.]] in a letter that is read on the commentary by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. (2003). Commentary for "[[Lisa the Greek]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

===Design===
The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.<ref>Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly in the middle of the sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used.<ref>Archer, Wes; Groening, Matt; Kirkland, Mark. (2005). "A Bit From the Animators", Illustrated Commentary for "[[Summer of 4 Ft. 2]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, ''Life in Hell''-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for ''The Simpsons''.<ref>Groening, Matt. (2004). Commentary for "[[Selma's Choice]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

===Voice===
[[File:Julie Kavner 1974.JPG|right|upright|thumb|[[Julie Kavner]]]]
Marge's voice is performed by [[Julie Kavner]], who also does the voices of Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma. Kavner had been part of the regular cast of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member [[Dan Castellaneta]] to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors.<ref name="The Age">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html |title=D'oh, you're the voices |access-date=October 30, 2008 |date=February 27, 2003 |author=Lee, Luaine |work=[[The Age]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102224412/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/02/27/1046064146568.html |archive-date=November 2, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="FN">{{cite news |url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/doh-the-voice-of-homer-is-deceivingly-deadpan |title=D'oh!: The Voice of Homer Is Deceivingly Deadpan |access-date=October 30, 2008 |date=August 18, 2008 |author=Elber, Lynn |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703090128/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C129665%2C00.html |archive-date=July 3, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to promote ''The Simpsons'' on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it "destroys the illusion.

===Personality===
Marge is generally a stereotypical sitcom mother, and she also plays the "long-suffering wife" who puts up with the antics of her children and her oafish husband.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=239–240}} While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in "[[Homer Alone]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]], 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a nervous breakdown.

Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky.

He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is "complete and utter dependence." At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he "really [does] make a gal feel needed."<ref name="Secrets"/> Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show.

Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in "[[Life on the Fast Lane]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 1)|season one]], 1990), where she resists Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite episode |title=Life on the Fast Lane |episode-link=Life on the Fast Lane |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=March 18, 1990 |season=01 |number=09}}</ref>

Marge is more caring, understanding, and nurturing toward Bart than Homer, but she refers to him as "a handful" and is often embarrassed by his antics.<ref name="Defined"/> In "[[Marge Be Not Proud]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]], 1995), she felt she was mothering Bart too much and started acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting.

Marge has a good relationship with Lisa and the two are shown to get along quite well. Marge over-mothers Maggie, which causes her to become too clingy and dependent on Marge.
Marge maintains a good relationship with her mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma, though they disapprove of Homer and are vocal about it. Marge has tolerated their criticism, but has occasionally lost patience with them, once referring to them as "ghouls".<ref name=MotherSimpson>{{cite episode |title=Mother Simpson |episode-link=Mother Simpson |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Richard Appel|Appel, Rich]]; [[David Silverman (animator)|Silverman, David]] |network=Fox |airdate=November 19, 1995 |season=07 |number=08}}</ref>

Marge's late father Clancy is rarely referred to in the series and has had speaking parts in only two episodes.<ref name=WayWeWas/> It was revealed in "[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]], 1994) that Clancy told Marge that he was a pilot, but in reality, he was a flight attendant.

Marge believes she has higher morals and is more law-abiding than most other characters, once leading a [[family values]] crusade against the violent ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]''<ref>{{cite episode |title=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |episode-link=Itchy & Scratchy & Marge |series=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; [[Jim Reardon|Reardon, Jim]] |network=Fox |airdate=December 20, 1990 |season=02 |number=09}}</ref> and being a prominent member of the "Citizens' Committee on Moral Hygiene".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart After Dark |episode-link=Bart After Dark |series=The Simpsons |credits=Appel, Rich; Polcino, Dominic |network=Fox |airdate=November 24, 1996 |season=08 |number=05}}</ref> She often provides a voice of reason for the town itself, but many of the townspeople are frustrated or contemptuous of her failure to recognize or react correctly to breaches of social norms.<ref name="$pringfield">{{cite episode |title=$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling) |episode-link=$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling) |series=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=December 16, 1993 |season=05 |number=10}}</ref>

Marge is the only member of the family who encourages, and often forces, church attendance. In "[[Homer the Heretic]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1992), Homer starts skipping church and Marge tells him "don't make me choose between my man and my God, because you just can't win."<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer the Heretic |episode-link=Homer the Heretic |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[George Meyer|Meyer, George]]; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=October 8, 1992 |season=04 |number=03}}</ref> Yet, in some episodes, Marge's stereotypical attitude seems to affect her relationship with Lisa, who is a feminist.  In "[[Lisa the Skeptic]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]], 1997), an "angel skeleton" is discovered, much to Lisa's skepticism. As Lisa rants about the people who believe it is an angel, Marge informs her that she also believes it is an angel. She tells Lisa, "There has to be more to life than just what we see, everyone needs something to believe in."<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Skeptic |episode-link=Lisa the Skeptic |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[David X.

In spite of her highly debatable moral stances, Marge struggles with vices, such as a gambling addiction.<ref name="$pringfield"/> While Marge has learned to cope with her addiction, it has never completely disappeared and remains an underlying problem that is referenced occasionally on the show.<ref>Reiss, Mike. (2003). Commentary for "[[Lisa the Greek]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox</ref>  Marge is also known to suffer [[OCD]] as shown when she won a house cleaning but she then cleaned the whole house herself and it thus led to her accidentally causing her to suffer [[amnesia]]. Another time is when the family had to house sit for [[Mr. Burns]], she forced Lisa and herself to clean the entire mansion.

[[Politics in The Simpsons|Politically]], Marge generally aligns with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], having supported the candidacy of her state's progressive [[Governor (United States)|governor]] [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Mary Bailey|Mary Bailey]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish |episode-link=Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish |series=The Simpsons |credits=Simon, Sam; Swartzwelder, John; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=November 1, 1990 |season=02 |number=04}}</ref> and voted for [[Jimmy Carter]] in both of his presidential elections.<ref name="Job"/> She was also deeply affected by the death of [[Lyndon B.

Marge and Lisa are [[James L. Brooks]]'s favorite characters in the series, and the two with whom he identifies with most. Marge and Lisa are more popular than Homer and Bart in Japan, France, and many French speaking countries. Matt Groening has spoken fondly of them, though he prefers Homer and Bart. Sam Simon also prefers Homer and Bart finding Marge and Lisa to be too "goody two-shoes" for his tastes.{{citation needed|date=December 2024}}
