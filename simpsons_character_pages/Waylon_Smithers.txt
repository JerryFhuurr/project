'''Waylon Joseph Smithers Jr.''', usually referred to as '''Mr. Smithers''', or simply '''Smithers''', is a recurring character in the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]. His first appearance was in the episode of "[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]", although his voice could be heard in the series premiere "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]". He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]'s owner [[Mr. Burns]], and is usually treated unfairly.

Smithers's loyalty and devotion to Mr. Burns was inspired from how numerous [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] executives and staff members acted towards [[Barry Diller]]. Smithers's first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer [[Wayland Flowers]].<ref name="Jeff Martin">{{cite podcast|last1=Goertz|first1=Allie|last2=Prescott|first2=Julia|title=I Married Marge (with Jeff Martin)|publisher=Maximum Fun|date=8 August 2016|time=61:28|url=http://podbay.fm/show/979023994/e/1470639600|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref name="sprcon" /> The idea for Smithers's ambiguous sexual orientation came from [[Sam Simon]]. He proposed that Smithers should be [[gay]] and have an undying love for Mr. Burns. Smithers was colorized in his first appearance as black with blue hair.<ref>{{cite web|title=Waylon Smithers from The Simpsons was originally black|url=http://www.omgfacts.com/hollywood/6540/Waylon-Smithers-from-The-Simpsons-was-originally-black|website=OMG Facts|publisher=Dose|access-date=10 December 2015}} {{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Matt Groening]], in an interview with [[TMZ]], said that this was a mistake but the producers did not have enough money to correct it.<ref>{{cite web|title='Simpsons' Creator Matt Groening Smithers Was Black By Mistake ...

==Sexual orientation==
Smithers is the loyal, obedient and [[sycophant]]ic assistant to Mr. Burns, and the relationship between the two is a frequent [[running gag]]. In many ways, Smithers represents the [[stereotype]] of a [[closeted]] [[gay man]]. Numerous allusions and [[double entendre]]s about his orientation being [[homosexual]] are made, though some of the show's producers instead interpret him as a "Burns-sexual". There has been speculation throughout the series of Smithers' sexuality and in the [[The Simpsons season 27|season 27]] (2016) episode "[[The Burns Cage]]", he officially [[coming out|came out]] as gay.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McDermott|first1=Maeve|title=Smithers officially came out as gay on 'The Simpsons'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/04/the-simpsons-smithers-comes-out-as-gay/82603440/|work=USA Today|access-date=1 June 2016}}</ref>

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Mr. Smithers is Mr. Burns's devoted executive assistant. His father, Waylon Smithers Sr., worked for Burns until he died of [[radiation poisoning]] after saving [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] from a potential [[nuclear meltdown]] when Smithers was a baby. Smithers began thinking of [[Mr. Burns]] as his commander shortly after his birth.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Blunder Years|episode-link=The_Blunder_Years |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Ian Maxtone-Graham|Maxtone-Graham, Ian]]; [[Steven Dean Moore|Moore, Steven Dean]]|network=Fox |airdate=December 9, 2001 |season=13 |number=05}}</ref> Up until 2016, he was not openly gay, but [[Open secret|most people knew]] he was homosexual before he came out. It was revealed in a flashback that he was married to a woman once, but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Secrets of a Successful Marriage|episode-link=Secrets_of_a_Successful_Marriage| series=The Simpsons|series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Greg Daniels|Daniels, Greg]]; Baeza, Carlos|network=Fox |airdate=May 19, 1994 |season=05 |number=22}}</ref> Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns, and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as "Burns-sexual". "He deserves his time," says the writer of "The Simpsons" about Smithers's gay love story in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Patrick|url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-simpsons-writer-talks-smithers-gay-love-story-he-deserves-his-time-3103681|title='The Simpsons' writer talks Smithers' gay love story: "He deserves his time"|website=Nme.com|date=24 November 2021|access-date=26 April 2022}}</ref>

Mr. Burns remained largely ignorant of Smithers's devoted adoration, much to Smithers's frustration. Mr. Burns himself has been involved with several women and, in "[[A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love]]", Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love|episode-link=A_Hunka_Hunka_Burns_in_Love |series=The Simpsons|series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder, John]]; Kramer, Lance |network=Fox |airdate=December 2, 2001 |season=09 |number=08}}</ref> Burns, for his part, views Smithers as somewhat of a [[Lackey (manservant)|lackey]], albeit a highly valued one for his competence. He has "rewarded" Smithers's devotion with the future "honor" of [[Vivisepulture|being buried alive]] [[Retainer sacrifice|with him after he dies]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Burns' Heir|episode-link=Burns'_Heir |series=The Simpsons|series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Richdale, Jace; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]] |network=Fox |airdate=April 14, 1994 |season=09 |number=08}}</ref> Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns. In "[[Homer the Smithers]]", Mr. Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and [[Homer Simpson]] is hired as a temporary replacement. When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face, Mr. Burns learns to become self-reliant and this results in Smithers being fired. Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns's assistant and eventually gets his job back.<ref name="HtS">{{cite episode |title=Homer the Smithers|episode-link=Homer_the_Smithers |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=February 25, 1996|season=7 |number=17}}</ref> In the [[The Simpsons season 27|season 27]] episode "[[The Burns Cage]]", Smithers attempts to admit his love to Burns, who interrupts to reaffirm his contempt for his assistant.<ref name=new>{{cite news|last1=Leszkiewicz|first1=Anna|title=The Smithers question: why do we keep retrofitting progressive narratives in pop culture?|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2016/04/smithers-question-why-do-we-keep-retrofitting-progressive-narratives-pop|access-date=April 6, 2016|work=[[New Statesman]]|publisher=[[Progressive Digital Media]]|location=London, England|date=April 5, 2016}}</ref>

Smithers's official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant, which he says is "actually about 2,800 smaller jobs",<ref name="HtS"/> responsible for monitoring employee attendance, and is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of employee-of-the-month awards.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer Defined|episode-link=Homer_Defined |series=The Simpsons|series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Gewirtz, Howard; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=October 17, 1991 |season=03 |number=05}}</ref> Smithers does appear to be one of the few people at the power plant who is seemingly competent at their job as opposed to the lazy, oafish underlings such as Homer Simpson and the senile Mr. Burns, who is often out of touch with the modern times. While some of his early appearances showed him to have a malicious side (he tried to get Homer fired over his insurance claim for a hair-growing product, and the only reason this failed is that Mr. Burns had sympathy for Homer due to his own incurable baldness and gave him his old job back), his overall characterization is fairly benevolent and he ultimately just wants the SNPP to run well. He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive [[vice president]], but Burns has repeatedly squashed this dream, while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on a dog.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer's Enemy|episode-link=Homer's_Enemy |series=The Simpsons|series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; [[Jim Reardon|Reardon, Jim]] |network=Fox |airdate=May 4, 1997 |season=08 |number=23}}</ref> Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in the world, and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club.<ref name="Malibu">{{cite episode |title=Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy|episode-link=Lisa_vs._Malibu_Stacy |series=The Simpsons|series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Oakley, Bill; [[Josh Weinstein|Weinstein, Josh]]; Lynch, Jeffrey|network=Fox |airdate=February 17, 1994 |season=05 |number=14}}</ref> In "[[Werking Mom]]", Smithers makes a silent cameo as a drag queen named 'The Mysterious Waylon'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season1/page4.shtml |title=BBC - Cult - the Simpsons: Season One Episode Guide - There's No Disgrace Like Home |website=www.bbc.co.uk |access-date=19 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030623185624/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season1/page4.shtml |archive-date=23 June 2003 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Smithers made his first appearance in "[[Homer's Odyssey (The Simpsons)|Homer's Odyssey]]", which was the third episode of the [[The Simpsons season 1|first season]], although he can be heard over a speaker in ''The Simpsons'' series premiere "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]".<ref name="bbc">[https://web.archive.org/web/20031012233630/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season1/page1.shtml Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire] BBC.

==Development==
Mr. Smithers's relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a [[running gag]] on ''The Simpsons''. Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns. There have often been strong hints about Smithers's true feelings for his boss, with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode "[[The Telltale Head]]".<ref name="ReissTTH"/> Smithers's sexual orientation has often come into question, with some fans claiming he is a "Burns-sexual" and only attracted to his boss, while others maintain that he is gay.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=296}} During the [[Bill Oakley]]/[[Josh Weinstein]] era, they still tried to keep his sexuality unspoken and there was debate among the writers about his orientation. [[Al Jean]], who thinks of Smithers as being a "Burns-sexual",<ref name="JeanBF">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode 'Blood Feud'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman, then Smithers would not be gay.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode 'Homer the Smithers'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], a former supervising director has said, "[Smithers] seems to be focused on one particular human, as opposed to anything beyond that.

[[File:SmithersDream.png|left|200px|thumb|Smithers dreams about Mr. Burns in "[[Marge Gets a Job]]". The censors had issues with the "lump in his bed", which was his knee.<ref name="Weinstein"/>]]
The debate is referenced in "[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]", when the episode host, [[Troy McClure]] is answering viewer questions, and one that is asked is "What is the real deal with Mr. Burns's assistant Smithers? You know what I'm talking about." A montage of various clips that shows Smithers's lust for Mr. Burns follows, and in the end, McClure says "as you can see, the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he's Mr. Burns's assistant. He's in his early forties, is unmarried, and currently resides in Springfield. Thanks for writing!"<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular|episode-link=The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jon Vitti|Vitti, Jon]]|network=Fox |airdate=December 3, 1995 |season=7 |number=10}}</ref>

Several of the allusions to Smithers's sexuality have turned into battles with the network censors. For example, in Smithers's fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in "[[Rosebud (The Simpsons)|Rosebud]]", the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked. Another example is "[[Marge Gets a Job]]", which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window. The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy, but originally it went on for a few seconds longer. It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed "Mr. Burns land[ing] in a particular position on Smithers's anatomy".<ref name="Oakley2">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode 'The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> There were also issues with "the lump in his bed", which the animators said had been drawn as his knee, but the censors had misinterpreted.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|year=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode 'The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

In the second season, the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns' relationship, and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus, but many never came to fruition.<ref name="VittiSaD">{{cite video | people=Vitti, Jon|year=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode 'Simpson and Delilah'| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Mostly in the early seasons, Smithers had a catchphrase, which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who [[Homer Simpson]] is. Smithers and Burns would watch Homer (usually over a security camera feed) and Burns would ask, "Who is that man?", to which Smithers would reply, "That's Homer Simpson, sir, one of your [drones, organ banks, carbon blobs, etc.] from sector 7G." Burns would invariably respond, "Simpson, eh?"{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=164}}

In September 2015, it was confirmed by Jean that Smithers would come out to Mr. Burns in a [[The Simpsons season 27|season 27]] episode.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holpuch|first1=Amanda|title=The Simpsons' Smithers to finally come out as gay, producer reveals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/28/smithers-mr-burns-assistant-simpsons-gay|access-date=October 24, 2015|work=The Guardian|date=September 28, 2015}}</ref> Though in the end he never came out to Mr. Burns as his attempt was cut short.
