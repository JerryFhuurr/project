They are twin sisters and are voiced by [[Julie Kavner]], who also voices their sister, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]].{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=1099}} Patty and Selma, both gravel-voiced chain-smokers, work at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[Department of Motor Vehicles]]. They have a strong dislike for their brother-in-law, [[Homer Simpson]], who likewise loathes them. Selma, the elder by two minutes, longs for male companionship and has had multiple brief, doomed marriages, and has herself offered help in some fashion to Marge and Homer as she envies their loving relationship; she receives occasional compassionate support from Homer who even poses as her husband to help her adopt a child. Patty is an initially closeted [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] who embraces celibacy until she begins dating women. Kavner voices them as characters who "suck the life out of everything".<ref name=joy>[http://www.snpp.com/other/articles/flash.html Rhodes, Joe. "Flash! 24 ''Simpsons'' Stars Reveal Themselves"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812090512/http://www.snpp.com/other/articles/flash.html |date=August 12, 2014 }}, ''TV Guide'' October 21, 2000, via The Simpsons Archive: "[Matt] Groening says: 'My original idea about Marge's family was they were utterly joyless. The original note I gave to Julie was that they suck the life out of everything they see'".</ref> Patty and Selma debuted on the first ''Simpsons'' episode "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", which aired on December 17, 1989.{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=25}}

==Distinguishing features==
Being twins, the two have a similar look, but there are several easy ways to distinguish them, including:

*''Hairstyle'': Patty has an [[afro]] perm, while Selma's hair is parted in the middle.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Patty and Selma in their real hair color.jpg|thumb|right|Patty and Selma showing their ''real'' hair color to their younger sister Marge (episode "[[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)|The Blue and the Gray]]").{{ffdc|Patty and Selma in their real hair color.jpg|log=2024 September 4|date=September 2024}}]] -->
*''Attire'': Patty wears a short-sleeved pink dress and pink shoes while Selma wears a hemmed sleeveless blue dress and blue shoes.
*''Jewelry'': Patty wears blue or orange triangular earrings and spherical beads connected by a visible string, while Selma wears orange or purple circular earrings (occasionally earrings shaped in an "S" in early episodes) and elliptical beads attached to each other.

They both resemble their chain-smoking father Clancy Bouvier who appeared in a flashback of the episode "The Way We Was". In the episode "[[The Blue and the Gray (The Simpsons)|The Blue and the Gray]]", it is revealed that Selma is actually a blonde, while Patty is a redhead. Their hair has turned blue-gray from long-term exposure to cigarette smoke and ash.

==Biography ==
Rarely seen apart, Patty and Selma are known for their distinctive gravelly voices, cynical outlook on life, bitter and unpleasant personalities, and love of cigarettes. They share an apartment at the [[Spinster]] City apartment complex and both work at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]]. The two are avid, sometimes maniacal fans of the TV series, ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]''. The two seem to be aroused by the character and smoke a cigarette after every viewing of the show.
When [[Jay Sherman]], on advice from Homer, told Patty and Selma that MacGyver is gay, they stripped him to his boxers and hung him from the gutters.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[A Star is Burns]]"</ref> On the eve of Selma's marriage to [[Sideshow Bob]], he insulted MacGyver and the wedding was almost cancelled as a result.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Black Widower]]"</ref> Selma and Patty once met the actor who portrayed MacGyver, [[Richard Dean Anderson]], and kidnapped him.<ref name="kiss kiss bangalore">''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore]]"</ref> Patty and Selma have taken many vacations together to various places including
[[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Dead Sea]], where Selma sunk to the bottom when she attempted to float on her back.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Flaming Moe's]]"</ref> Patty and Selma have also brought home "souvenirs" from their vacations, including a pillowcase full of seashells from their trip to Sulfur Bay that they forced the family to help them clean and organize.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]"</ref> They drove away Richard Dean Anderson by showing him slides of their trip to the [[Remington Carriage Museum]] in [[Cardston, Alberta]].<ref name="kiss kiss bangalore"/>

Patty and Selma have a strong, mutually reciprocated dislike for their brother-in-law [[Homer Simpson|Homer]]. They regret that Marge chose Homer over her former boyfriend [[Artie Ziff]],<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[The Way We Was]]"</ref> and have unsuccessfully tried to help Artie win her back.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Half-Decent Proposal]]"</ref><ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]"</ref> However, Marge made it clear to her sisters that she loves Homer and there is nothing they can do to change her mind. Homer usually tries to be polite to them out of respect for Marge, but Patty and Selma do not hide their contempt for him. They showed little concern when Homer suffered a heart attack. While he was undergoing bypass surgery, they tried to set Marge up with a sleazy man named Andre.<ref name="TripleBypass">''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]"</ref> They own a tombstone inscribed with the epitaph "Homer J. Simpson. We are richer for having lost him" and use it as a coffee table,<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Mother Simpson]]"</ref> stick pins in a voodoo doll which looks like Homer<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Homer and Apu]]"</ref> and even commissioned a billboard urging voters to evict Homer from Springfield.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Three Gays of the Condo]]"</ref> When Homer contemplated suicide, they encouraged him to go through with it and then pushed him off the bridge, though this was actually part of a plot by the townspeople to bring Homer to his surprise party on a cruise ship.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind]]"</ref> Patty has also given stoner [[Otto Mann]] a driver's license due to their mutual dislike for Homer,<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[The Otto Show]]"</ref> and both she and Selma deliberately failed Homer on his limousine driver's test, but their victory smoking nearly cost them their jobs until Homer intervened.<ref name="vsPattyAndSelma">''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Homer vs. Patty and Selma]]"</ref> They once kidnapped Homer before his and Marge's third wedding and imprisoned him in a cellar in the hope that Marge would find someone else. Moved to tears by his obvious devotion to Marge, they let him go and paid for their wedding ceremony to avoid being exposed by Bart and Lisa.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Wedding for Disaster]]"</ref> For his part, Homer regards them as the "Gruesome Twosome"<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]"</ref> or "Fatty and Smellma"<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[The Fat and the Furriest]]</ref> and was delighted when he (mistakenly) heard they had died.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[American History X-cellent]]"</ref>

As children, Patty and Selma were apparently domineering towards Marge and ridiculed her ambition of becoming an astronaut. In return for their allowance, Marge used to do chores for them. The free time they now had led to them taking up smoking.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]"</ref> As adults, the Bouvier twins have a friendly relationship with their sister and seem very protective of her thus frequently visit the Simpsons. They seem relatively fond of their nieces and nephew, but seem to like them more when they are young, as one of them remarks "The older they get, the cuter they ain't."<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Lisa's First Word]]"</ref> On occasions, they babysit Bart, Lisa and Maggie, something not relished by the kids. Bart and Lisa were left traumatized when they had to stay with their aunts for a week while a stressed out Marge left for Rancho Relaxo. Maggie managed to take evasive action and got to stay with Homer instead.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Homer Alone]]"</ref>

===Patty Bouvier===
'''Patricia Maleficent Bouvier''' is the younger of the two.<ref name="SomethingAbout"/> Despite the similarities between her and Selma, Patty is more jaded than her sister, particularly towards relationships. It was once said by Marge that Patty chose a life of [[celibacy]], and that Selma had it thrust upon her.<ref name="PrincipalCharming">''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Principal Charming]]"</ref> Her decision to not have relationships has been implied to be due to her then closeted sexuality. Earlier hints of her closeted sexuality were also shown in some of the show's earlier episodes, when she was reluctant to date Principal Skinner in [[Principal Charming]]; in [[Treehouse of Horror III]], on seeing Homer naked, she claimed the experience destroyed "the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality." Generally, Patty is more hostile to Homer than Selma. However, when Patty came out as a [[lesbian]], she found a surprising supporter in Homer (in contrast to Marge who was at first surprised and angry about it), and she swallowed her pride and asked him to perform her marriage ceremony.<ref name="SomethingAbout"/> They also teamed up to try to scupper the burgeoning relationship between Selma and Homer's father [[Abe Simpson|Abe]].<ref name="RomeJuli" /> Patty also joined Homer's group to ghost-write an original fantasy fiction novel, and also to stop their novel from being replaced with a drastically revamped version by the book publishing company.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[The Book Job]]"</ref> In one episode, where Patty stayed at the Simpson house during a fight with Selma despite Homer's reluctance, Patty privately admitted to Homer that she only mocks him because she is jealous of him having a successful marriage and family with Marge, while all she has is Selma, leaving Homer feeling grateful for her having opened, albeit briefly, a window of kindness.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Puffless]]"</ref>

====Relationships====
Patty's only known relationship with a man involved [[Principal Skinner]].<ref name="PrincipalCharming"/> On a blind date arranged by Homer, Skinner was supposed to fall for Selma, but he noticed Patty first and fell in love with her instead. They dated for a while, though Patty often showed signs of reluctance through things like unjoyful facial expressions and turned down his marriage proposal, claiming him she was too devoted to Selma to abandon her. However, she did consider Skinner a gentleman and ended their relationship with the words "Good night, sweet principal."<ref name="PrincipalCharming"/> Like Selma, Patty also has a long-running fixation on ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', although this aspect of her personality has been played down in later episodes.

Patty was revealed to be lesbian in the [[The Simpsons season 16|season 16]] episode "[[There's Something About Marrying]]", which follows [[Homer Simpson]] as he is ordained to perform [[same-sex marriage]]s. Producer [[Al Jean]] had announced that a character would [[Coming out|come out]] prior to the episode's airing, prompting widespread speculation.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |date=2004-07-28 |title=Simpsons to reveal gay character |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3932369.stm |access-date=2023-04-14 |archive-date=2022-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220512161955/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3932369.stm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news |date=2005-02-21 |title=Simpsons' gay character is Patty |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4285287.stm |access-date=2023-04-14 |archive-date=2022-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220703222458/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4285287.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> Patty was the character that fans most suspected would come out.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Waxman |first=Sharon |date=2005-02-21 |title='Simpsons' Animates Gay Nuptials, and a Debate |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/21/arts/television/simpsons-animates-gay-nuptials-and-a-debate.html |access-date=2023-04-14 |issn=0362-4331 |archive-date=2022-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220512161958/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/21/arts/television/simpsons-animates-gay-nuptials-and-a-debate.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":0" /> The episode aired in 2005, when same-sex marriage was a major political issue in the United States.<ref name=":1" /> The move was controversial, provoking outrage from opponents to same-sex marriage.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keslowitz |first=Steven |url=https://archive.org/details/worldaccordingto0000kesl |title=The World According to the Simpsons: What Our Favorite TV Family Says about Life, Love, and the Pursuit of the Perfect Donut |publisher=Sourcebooks |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-4022-0655-9 |pages=25 |language=en}}</ref> Entertainment columnist [[Ray Richmond]] credited Patty's coming out as a significant milestone for the [[gay rights movement]], as it proved that the movement was prominent enough to feature in an episode of a mainstream sitcom.<ref name=":2" />

After coming out as a lesbian,<ref name="SomethingAbout"/> Patty exclaims "you could see it from space!". There had been many previous hints of her sexuality: she was seen visiting a burlesque house;<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Bart After Dark]]"</ref> she exclaimed (upon seeing Homer naked) "There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality";<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Treehouse of Horror III]]"</ref> she was seen hiding in a closet with [[Waylon Smithers|Smithers]] on a parade float during a gay pride parade.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Jaws Wired Shut]]"</ref> In another nod to Patty's sexuality being obvious, Homer [[sarcasm|sarcastically]] quipped, "Here's another bomb for ya, Marge: I like beer!" when Marge was shocked at the revelation.

Patty wooed a tenured professor from [[Yale University]] away from her husband<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Homer Simpson, This is Your Wife]]"</ref> and has also been attracted to [[Edna Krabappel]].<ref name="RomeJuli"/> When Selma claimed she couldn't face prison, Patty replied that she could, implying she would welcome a female-only environment.<ref name="kiss kiss bangalore"/> Patty's first serious relationship with a woman was with Veronica, a pro golfer. It was later discovered by Marge and revealed during Patty's wedding that Veronica was actually a man in disguise.<ref name="SomethingAbout" /> Patty's next serious relationship with a woman was with Evelyn, who quickly bonded with Homer over similar traits during a trip to Costa Rica. When Marge pointed out that Evelyn was ruining the trip and was a female version of Homer, a horrified Patty broke up with her. However, when a remorseful Marge apologized to Patty and reassured her that the difference between Homer and Evelyn was that Evelyn truly loved her, Patty decided to reconcile with Evelyn.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Livin La Pura Vida |episode-link=Livin La Pura Vida |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |first1=Timothy |last1=Bailey |first2=Brian |last2=Kelley |author-link2=Brian Kelley (writer) |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |date=November 17, 2019 |season=31 |number=7 |minutes= |time=}}</ref>

===Selma Bouvier===
'''Selma Bouvier''' is two minutes older than Patty. Due to a childhood bottle rocket accident, she has no sense of taste or smell.<ref name="BlackWidower">''[[The Simpsons]]''- "[[Black Widower]]"</ref> According to Marge, Selma "likes ''[[Police Academy (franchise)|Police Academy]]'' movies and [[Hummel figurines]], and walking through the park on clear autumn days." In contrast to her twin, Selma yearns for male companionship and children. She is also slightly more sympathetic towards Homer than Patty. Selma helped reunite Homer and Marge after seeing how upset Marge was without him, despite an agreement with Patty not to say anything.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[I Married Marge]]"</ref> Homer was sympathetic to her when she broke down after a disastrous trip to Duff Gardens with Bart and Lisa, remarking "I just couldn't cut it today", referring to raising kids.<ref name="SelmasChoice"/> Homer also agreed to pose as Selma's husband to help her adopt a baby from China.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Goo Goo Gai Pan]]"</ref> During Homer and Marge's trial separation, when Marge went out on a date with someone else, Selma called Homer and offered to help him save their marriage, but was left frustrated when Homer mistook her for Patty over the phone.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' – "[[Every Man's Dream]]"</ref>

Unable to find companionship in a man, Selma has also sought to have children. At one point she considered using a [[sperm donor]] which Homer mistakenly thought meant Selma would have sex with a robot.<ref name="SelmasChoice"/> After babysitting [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] for a day, she realized she was not ready to have children and wound up adopting [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Jub-Jub|Jub-Jub]], her late Aunt Gladys's pet iguana.<ref name="SelmasChoice">''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Selma's Choice]]"</ref><ref>According to a ''The Simpsons'' [[DVD commentary]] and by episode writer O'Brien on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''</ref> Much later, she adopted a Chinese baby girl, [[Simpson family#Ling Bouvier|Ling]]. During the adoption process, Selma pretended to be married to Homer, since the Chinese government only allows children to be adopted by married couples.<ref>[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/tnbt/episodes/2003/10/10 "In the Family Way"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028042157/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/tnbt/episodes/2003/10/10 |date=October 28, 2006 }}, ''[[The Next Big Thing (radio series)|The Next Big Thing]]'', October 10, 2003. [[Julia Sweeney]] tells about the messages she received from Chinese adoption agencies trying to confirm her heterosexuality due to government opposition to gay adoption</ref> After the fraud was exposed, Selma managed to keep the baby as a Chinese dignitary (voiced by [[Lucy Liu]]), who had also been raised by a single parent, became sympathetic.

====Relationships====
Despite being identical twins, Patty and Selma have very different track records when it comes to finding dates. According to Marge, Patty chose a life of [[celibacy]], while Selma had celibacy thrust upon her. Her standards are extremely low, as evidenced by her comments on [[Mr. Burns]]: "Single? Well, he passes the Selma Test."

Selma has actively sought out a husband, and has been married to six different men. Her current name has evolved into '''Selma Bouvier-Terwilliger-Hutz-McClure-Stu-Simpson-D'Amico'''. Her first marriage, to [[Sideshow Bob|Robert "Sideshow Bob" Terwilliger]], ended when his plan to kill her was foiled by Bart.<ref name="BlackWidower"/> After an off-screen marriage to [[Lionel Hutz]],<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' "[[Much Apu About Nothing]]"</ref> she began dating [[Troy McClure]]. They married, but she soon discovered it was just a sham to boost his flagging career. She told him she was unwilling to bring a baby into a loveless marriage and broke it off.<ref name="FishCalledSelma">''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[A Fish Called Selma]]"</ref> Another unseen marriage was to [[Disco Stu]],<ref name="SomethingAbout">''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[There's Something About Marrying]]"</ref> which was annulled by the [[John Paul II|Pope]]. For a time she dated [[Abraham Simpson|Abe Simpson]], to the horror of Homer and Patty. Despite their objections, the two got married, but came to realize it would not work due to his age and her job, so they called it quits.<ref name="RomeJuli">''[[The Simpsons]]''"[[Rome-old and Juli-eh]]"</ref> Her most recent husband is [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony D'Amico]], though he was already married and regarded Selma as his "[[comare|gumare]]".<ref name="FatTony">''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[The Real Housewives of Fat Tony]]"</ref> It has been implied that Selma had a second failed marriage to Sideshow Bob, giving her a total of seven marriages.<ref name="RomeJuli"/>

One person Selma refused to marry was [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], because she said her collection of last names was long enough. However, there is evidence that she slept with Apu after Homer and Marge's second wedding. Selma has also dated various other men around Springfield, among them [[Hans Moleman]],<ref name="FishCalledSelma"/> [[Moe Szyslak]],<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[['Scuse Me While I Miss The Sky]]"</ref> and pitifully, [[Barney Gumble]].<ref name="PrincipalCharming"/> She was rejected by [[Groundskeeper Willie]], who upon seeing her dating video remarked "Back to the [[Loch Ness Monster|Loch with you Nessie]]".<ref name="SelmasChoice"/>

Series creator [[Matt Groening]] said he suggested that Kavner voice Patty and Selma as characters who "suck the life out of everything...."<ref name=joy /><ref name="Groening">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |year=2001 |title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode 'Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire' |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Al Jean]] said Kavner makes Patty's voice more masculine and a lower register, while Selma's voice is a little sweeter.<ref name=Selma>{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |year=2004 |title=The Simpsons The Complete Fourth Season DVD commentary for the episode "Selma's Choice" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

In the 2005 episode "[[There's Something About Marrying]]" of the sixteenth season, Patty was revealed to be a lesbian and became the first openly gay recurring character in the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eonline.com/news//article/index.jsp?uuid=fd0da574-316b-4300-80a7-8662f9a096b2&entry=index |title="Simpsons'" Smithers Part of Shrinking Minority? |author=Finn, Natalie |access-date=August 22, 2006 |date=November 7, 2007 |publisher=[[E!

According to the publications ''Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture'' and ''Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights'', it was the controversial lesbian outing of the main character (played by [[Ellen DeGeneres]]) in the sitcom ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'' in 1997 that paved the way for Patty's coming-out in "There's Something About Marrying", as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows.<ref>{{cite book |title=Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture |year=2005 |publisher=Metatronics, Inc. |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKA7AQAAIAAJ&q=patty+gay+ellen+%22the+simpsons%22}}</ref><ref name=Brewer>{{cite book |last=Brewer |first=Paul Ryan |title=Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights |year=2008 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-6211-0 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U34pJTdF-VcC&q=patty+gay+%22the+simpsons%22&pg=PA49}}</ref> In his book ''Queers in American Popular Culture'', Jim Elledge noted that it is possible the ''Simpsons'' staff chose Patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were "traditionally considered more acceptable" on television. She did, however, not "adhere to the eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into the loveable, asexual guise of the comedy lesbian" that had previously been seen on shows such as ''Ellen''. Instead, Patty is "rude, crude, and not ashamed of declaring her sexual preferences", and this could make her unpalatable to some viewers according to Elledge.<ref name=Elledge>{{cite book |last=Elledge |first=Jim |title=Queers in American Popular Culture (Volume 2) |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-35457-1 |pages=266–269 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qp52mROzDMYC&q=%22There%27s+Something+About+Marrying%22}}</ref>

<nowiki>*</nowiki>The first reference to Patty being gay, however, happened long before this 2005 episode, going all the way back to 1993, in season 4, episode 5: Treehouse of Horror III. in this Episode, Homer runs through the kitchen naked where Marge, Patty and Selma are all eating. Patty and Selma each put down their forks, and Patty remarks "There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality". Since this is a Halloween episode, however, fans might not have presumed this to be canon.
