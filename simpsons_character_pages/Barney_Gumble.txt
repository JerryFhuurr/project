'''Barnard Arnold''' "'''Barney'''" '''Gumble Sr.'''<ref name="A Star Is Burns">{{cite episode |title=A Star Is Burns |episode-link=A Star Is Burns |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=Fox |airdate=1995-03-05 |season=6 |number=18 |time=20:32 |credits=Keeler, Ken; Dietter, Susie}}</ref> is a recurring character in the American [[animated series|animated]] TV series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is [[voice acting|voiced]] by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared in the series premiere episode "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]".

Barney is the [[town drunk]] of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and one of [[Homer Simpson]]'s friends. His loud belches and desperation for alcohol serve as frequent sources of humor on the show, though Barney sobered up in the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|Season 11]] episode "[[Days of Wine and D'oh'ses]]" before relapsing three years later. Barney was inspired by the cartoon character [[Barney Rubble]] from ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and by several [[wikt:barfly|barflies]] from other television programs. In 2004, Castellaneta won an [[Emmy Award]] for voicing various characters, including Barney.

Barney can be seen in ''The Simpsons'' opening credits since 2009, passed out under a pile of leaves (but still holding his beloved bottle of [[Duff Beer]]) and being awoken by [[Bart Simpson]] skateboarding over his stomach, causing him to let out his trademark belch.

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Barney's father, Arnie Gumble, was a [[World War II]] veteran who died in 1979 in a parade float accident.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in 'The Curse of the Flying Hellfish' |episode-link=Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in "The Curse of the Flying Hellfish" |series=The Simpsons |credits=Collier, Jonathan; Lynch, Jeffrey |network=Fox |airdate=1996-04-28}}</ref> Little is known about his mother, except that she lives in [[Norway]]<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa the Greek |episode-link=Lisa the Greek |series=The Simpsons |credits=Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace |network=Fox |airdate=1992-01-23}}</ref> and that she served in the [[United States Navy]], including duty on a submarine. She is seen in the season nine episode "[[Simpson Tide]]". In "[[Treehouse of Horror XVII]]", Barney stated that he was [[Polish people|Polish]], after mistakenly saying he was [[Irish people|Irish]] in a drunken stupor. Barney was born on April 20 (which Homer remembers is also [[Hitler]]'s birthday in "[[Viva Ned Flanders]]") In "[[A Star Is Burns]]", Barney states that he is 40 years old. Several episodes, starting with "[[The Way We Was]]", depict him as Homer's best friend in [[high school]]. In the episode "[[$pringfield]]", he claims that he studied [[dance]] for several years, including [[Modern dance|modern]] and [[tap dance|tap]].

Two episodes give different reasons for his alcoholism. "[[Mr. Plow]]" suggests that Barney was a dedicated student looking forward to a bright future. He had his mind set on going to [[Harvard University]], until Homer peer pressured him into drinking beer the day before the [[SAT]]s.<ref name=mrplow>{{cite episode |title=Mr. Plow |episode-link=Mr. Plow |series=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=1992-11-19}}</ref> [[The Simpsons (season 16)|Season 16]]'s "[[She Used to Be My Girl]]" attributes his drinking to his high school girlfriend Chloe Talbot leaving [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] to pursue a journalism career.<ref name=mygirl>{{cite episode |title=She Used to Be My Girl |episode-link=She Used to Be My Girl |series=The Simpsons |credits=Long, Tim; Nastuk, Matthew |network=Fox |airdate=2004-12-05}}</ref>

In "[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]", Barney formed a barbershop quartet with Homer, [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]], and [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]] called the Be Sharps. Barney was asked to join when the other members heard him singing in a beautiful tenor voice in the restroom of [[Moe's Tavern]], replacing the group's original fourth member, [[Chief Wiggum]], who had been kicked out. In 1986, the Be Sharps won a [[Grammy Award]] for Outstanding Soul, Spoken Word, or Barbershop Album of the Year. Soon, creative disputes arose, and Barney left the group in all but name when [[Yoko Ono|he began dating a Japanese conceptual artist]]. The group realized that they were no longer popular and split up.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer's Barbershop Quartet |episode-link=Homer's Barbershop Quartet |series=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1993-09-30}}</ref>

Barney was rescued from a tar pit by Bart's pet elephant Stampy in "[[Bart Gets an Elephant]]" and he also started a snowplowing business rivaling Homer's in "Mr. Plow". Barney's commercial [[defamation|defamed]] Homer, causing Homer to lose his customers. As revenge, Homer fooled Barney into plowing a driveway on Widow's Peak, a treacherous mountain just outside Springfield. When Homer saw a news report showing that Barney had become trapped in an [[avalanche]], Homer immediately drove to the mountain and rescued Barney. The friends resolved their differences and agreed to work together. However, a [[heat wave]] hit Springfield at that exact moment, driving them both out of business.<ref name=mrplow/> However, in the episodes "[[O Brother, Where Bart Thou?]]" and "[[Miracle on Evergreen Terrace]]" it is shown that Barney still drives his Plow King truck.

After being forced to spend a sober night at [[Moe's Tavern]] serving as [[designated driver]], Barney left town in Homer Simpson's car to, among other things, give a guest lecture at [[Villanova University|Villanova]] (although, by his own admission, the guest lecture could just have likely occurred on a street corner). He ultimately abandoned the car in [[New York City]] and returned to Springfield after a two-month absence. A gag in "[[Selma's Choice]]" suggests that Barney is the father of many local babies born through (presumably, paid) donation of [[semen]] and the resulting [[artificial insemination]].

Barney made a [[documentary film]] about his life as an [[alcoholic]], titled ''Pukahontas''. It won the top prize at the Springfield Film Festival. He was ready to quit drinking after winning the Festival, but the prize he received was a lifetime supply of Duff Beer.<ref name="A Star Is Burns"/> In "[[Deep Space Homer]]", Barney trained to become an astronaut for [[NASA]]. Under their alcohol-ban, he quickly regained his balance and diction and was quite appropriately selected to fly with [[Buzz Aldrin]]. However, he reverted to his old ways when he was presented with a bottle of non-alcoholic champagne.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Deep Space Homer |episode-link=Deep Space Homer |series=The Simpsons |credits=Mirkin, David; Baeza, Carlos |network=Fox |airdate=1994-02-12}}</ref> Barney served in the [[United States Navy Reserve]] as a [[submarine]]r on the [[Jebediah Springfield|USS ''Jebediah'']], alongside his mother, in "[[Simpson Tide]]".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Simpson Tide |episode-link=Simpson Tide |series=The Simpsons |credits=Sternin, Joshua and Jeffrey Ventimilia; Gray, Milton |network=Fox |airdate=1998-03-29}}</ref>

In "[[Days of Wine and D'oh'ses]]", after watching a video of his drunken antics at his birthday party, Barney resolves to get [[sobriety|sober]]. He attends [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings, cleans up his appearance, and attends helicopter-flying lessons. He remains sober by the episode's end, though his alcoholism is replaced by an unhealthy [[Caffeine dependence|dependence on coffee]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Days of Wine and D'oh'ses |episode-link=Days of Wine and D'oh'ses |series=The Simpsons |credits=Lacusta, Deb and Dan Castellaneta; Affleck, Neil |network=Fox |airdate=2000-04-09}}</ref> It was revealed in the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|fourteenth season]] episode "[[I'm Spelling as Fast as I Can]]" that he had relapsed.

==Character==
===Creation===
Barney was inspired by [[Barney Rubble]], [[Fred Flintstone]]'s best friend and next-door neighbor from the animated series ''[[The Flintstones]]''.<ref name=firstepisode>Groening, Matt (2001). Commentary for "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The writers originally wanted the character to be [[Homer Simpson]]'s sidekick and next-door neighbor, but instead, while still portraying him as Homer's best friend, they decided to make him an alcoholic. [[Ned Flanders]] would become the next-door neighbor instead.<ref name=firstepisode /> "Barney was taking the standard sitcom sidekick and just making him as pathetic as possible," said [[Matt Groening]], the creator of ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=tvguide>{{cite magazine |last=Rhodes |first=Joe |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |date=2000-10-21 }}</ref> The writers drew further inspiration from Crazy Guggenheim, a character played by comedian [[Frank Fontaine]] on ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]''.<ref name=tvguide/> Part of the reason the writers went in that direction, according to Groening, was because of "a sort of unspoken rule about not having drinking on television as a source of comedy. So, of course, we went right for it."<ref name=tvguide/> The writers also patterned the character after [[Norm Peterson]] ([[George Wendt]]), a character from the sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''.<ref>Castellaneta, Dan; Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Moore, Rich; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David (2003). Commentary for "[[Flaming Moe's]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

In some early [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]] episodes, Barney had yellow hair. Later in the production of that season, the producers had it changed to brown, because they thought that his hair looked like his skin;<ref>Jean, Al (2001). Commentary for "[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> in addition, during an artistic convention of the show, Groening stated that he wanted only the [[Simpson family|Simpsons]] to have yellow hair.<ref name=firstepisode/> Animation director [[Rich Moore]] modeled Barney's apartment on one he and several other animators who worked on the show shared, particularly the [[Farrah Fawcett]] poster and the cable spool table.<ref>Moore, Rich (2001). Commentary for "[[Homer's Night Out]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The writers originally intended for the character to be the owner of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Barney's Bowl-A-Rama|Barney's Bowl-A-Rama]].<ref name=fastlane>Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Silverman, David (2001). Commentary for "[[Life on the Fast Lane]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> However, after making him "pathetic", they could not regard him as a business owner any longer, and it was explained seasons later in "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]" that his Uncle Al owns the alley and named it after him.<ref name=fastlane/><ref>Groening, Matt; Silverman, David (2005). Commentary for "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

===Voice===
[[File:Dan Castellaneta 2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Dan Castellaneta]], the voice of Barney.]]
Barney Gumble is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997|p=165}} who said he drew inspiration from [[Mr. Magoo]]'s nephew Waldo on the 1957 record album ''Magoo in Hi-Fi'' where Waldo was voiced by [[Daws Butler]] as well as a little big Frank Fontane's Crazy Guggenheim. Early on in the show, Castellaneta discovered that it was not easy for him to do Barney's trademark belch every time a script called for it, so he identified his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard, the belch also appears on an episode of ''[[The Pitts]]''.<ref>Jean, Al (2002). Commentary for "[[Blood Feud (The Simpsons)|Blood Feud]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Castellaneta has voiced Barney every time he has appeared in the series, with the exception of the episode "[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]", in which some of Barney's singing is provided by a member of [[The Dapper Dans]], who recorded lines for all four members of the Be Sharps.<ref name="Barbershopcomment" /> Their recordings were intermixed with the cast's, often with a cast member singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing backup.<ref name="Barbershopcomment">Martin, Jeff; Reiss, Mike (2004). Commentary for "[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' DVD. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

===Sobriety===
Castellaneta thought of the idea of Barney sobering up early in the series. He wrote a script together with his wife [[Deb Lacusta]]. They offered their script to [[showrunner]] [[Al Jean]]. Jean liked the story, but felt that it was too similar to a script the writers were already working on, "[[Duffless]]", so he turned it down. Castellaneta and Lacusta waited several years and offered their script, which they updated, to then-show runner [[Mike Scully]], who liked it and had them make a few changes.<ref name=daysofwine>Affleck, Neil; Castellaneta, Dan; Lacusta, Deb; Maxtone-Graham, Ian; Meyer, George; Scully, Mike (2008). Commentary for "[[Days of Wine and D'oh'ses]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Their script became the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|eleventh season]] episode "[[Days of Wine and D'oh'ses]]", which first aired April 9, 2000.<ref>{{cite book |last=McCann |first=Jesse L. |title=The Simpsons Beyond Forever! A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family...Still Continued |year=2002 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=978-0-06-050592-9|title-link=The Simpsons Beyond Forever!: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family ...Still Continued }}</ref> The episode was directed by [[Neil Affleck]], who said that he had "a vested interest in getting Barney sober."<ref name=daysofwine/> However, some of the writing staff was opposed to the episode as they felt Barney sober would not be funny.<ref name=tvguide/> Castellaneta commented, "He's still a goofy man-child...he's still got 15 years of booze left in his veins."<ref name=tvguide/>

After a long discussion about how the episode should end, the writers decided that they did not want Barney to return to being drunk at the end of the episode. Barney stayed sober for several seasons. The animators modified the appearance of the character, straightening his hair, among other things, to indicate his sobriety. Castellaneta altered his voice for the character by no longer slurring.<ref name=daysofwine/> Barney was still seen at Moe's Tavern, but only drinking [[latte]]s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Loerzel |first=Robert |title=D'oh!
