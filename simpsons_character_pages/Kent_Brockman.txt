==Profile==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:You Kent Always Say What You Want.png|225px|thumb|left|Brockman interviewing [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] in "[[You Kent Always Say What You Want]]"]] -->
Kent Brockman hosts the [[Media in The Simpsons|Channel 6]] weekday news, as well as ''[[Media in The Simpsons#Journalism|Smartline]]'', a local current-affairs program (a parody of the national current-affairs program ''[[Nightline]]''), ''[[Media in The Simpsons#Bite Back with Kent Brockman|Bite Back! With Kent Brockman]]'' (a parody of ''[[Fight Back! With David Horowitz]]''), ''[[Media in The Simpsons#Journalism|Eye on Springfield]]'' (a parody of ''Eye on LA''), which focuses mostly on [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield's]] entertainment news, the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares#Parodies|Springfield Squares]]'',  ''Springfield Action News,'' and has his own personal commentary segment of the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. news, "My Two Cents".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |title=The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1997 |isbn=0-06-095252-0 |edition=1st |location=New York, NY |pages=41 |language=en}}</ref> In the episode "The Mansion Family", he co-hosted an award show with pop music singer [[Britney Spears]].

It has been hinted that Brockman is ethnically [[Judaism|Jewish]], having changed his surname from Brockelstein; this was first indicated in a 1960s flashback featured in the episode "[[Mother Simpson]]", in which Brockman was known as '''Kenny Brockelstein''' early in his career. He can sometimes be spotted wearing the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Chai (symbol)|Chai]] symbol on a necklace. However, he is seen several times attending [[Reverend Lovejoy]]'s [[Protestant]] church, and in "[[Marge on the Lam]]" he states his belief in the [[Book of Revelation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F03.html |title=&#91;1F03&#93; Marge on the Lam |access-date=February 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204084357/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F03.html |archive-date=December 4, 2014 }}</ref> suggesting he professes Christian religious beliefs.

Brockman has a daughter, Brittany, who may have been the product of his fling with the Channel 6 weather girl. He also has a wife named Stephanie. In "[[Kamp Krusty]]", Brockman is revealed to have during his career, reported on the [[Vietnam War]], the 1979–89 [[Soviet–Afghan War]], and the 1991 [[Gulf War]].

In "[[Dog of Death]]", Brockman won the multimillion-dollar ($130 million) state [[lottery]] jackpot and left the [[news desk]] while still on the air. However, he remained a news anchor because he was under contract, though he also admitted that he likes making $500,000 a year. He has an ongoing feud with traffic reporter [[Arnie Pye]], and has been shown to criticize Pye's reporting and also even chuckles when it was thought Pye had died in a helicopter accident. When Arnie Pye took Brockman's anchor position he admitted on the air he made out with Brockman's daughter but was sure to note it was with "the grown up one", thus revealing Brockman has an adult daughter.

Brockman's penchant for using offensive language worked against him in the 400th episode, "[[You Kent Always Say What You Want]]", where, after Homer accidentally spilled coffee on Brockman's crotch, he shouted what [[Ned Flanders]] called a "super swear" that shocked everyone who watches it. Brockman was demoted to [[weather forecasting|weather man]] due to the station paying a fine to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and was soon fired when the network executives deliberately mistook a ring of [[Splenda]] in Brockman's coffee for [[cocaine]]. Brockman was later given his job back to silence him (after doing an exposé that was seen on [[YouTube]] uncovering the real reason the FCC is cracking down on obscenity in the media), with a 50% raise, making his new salary $750,000 a year.

==Cultural influence==
Brockman is responsible for popularizing the [[snowclone]] "I, for one, welcome our new ''[fill-in-the-blank]'' overlords", sometimes used to express mock submission, usually for the purpose of humor.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=293–294}} Brockman's comment about believing a spacecraft was taken over by a master race of giant space ants in "[[Deep Space Homer]]" (1994), which generated the [[Internet meme|meme]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hornshaw |first1=Phil |title=''The Simpsons'' 30th Anniversary: 12 Best.

The spacecraft was carrying an ant colony, though the insects were accidentally released by Homer. This led to an ant drifting by the video feed, appearing gigantic due to its proximity to the camera, at which point Brockman contemplates if the "master race of giant space ants ... will consume the captive earth men or merely enslave them" and eventually utters the line "And I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords".  Author [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] called it "perhaps his finest hour as a journalist"{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=403}} and said the scene is "simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=69}}

Variations of the phrase have been used in the media, such as ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/2007/06/british-government-welcomes-our-new.html|title=The British government welcomes our new insect overlords|magazine=[[New Scientist]]|access-date=December 30, 2008|date=June 5, 2007}}</ref> the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/End-food-truck-wars-4264461.php|title=End food truck wars|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|access-date=February 11, 2013|date=February 10, 2013}}</ref> and [[Ken Jennings]] on the ''[[List of Jeopardy! tournaments and events#IBM Challenge|Jeopardy!

==Reception==
The author of the book ''[[Planet Simpson|Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]]'', [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]], said that "if the institution of the News has a single iconic face on ''The Simpsons'', it's Brockman's"{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=400}} and that "in Brockman's journalism, we see some of the modern news media's ugliest biases", which he identifies as glibness,{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=400}} amplification, and [[sensationalism]].{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=402}} [[MSN]] called Brockman one of the worst TV news anchors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Semel|first=Paul|title=The Best & Worst TV News Anchors|publisher=[[MSN]]|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/bestworstnewscasters-2/|access-date=December 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121170244/http://tv.msn.com/tv/bestworstnewscasters-2/|archive-date=January 21, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>
