'''Ralph Wiggum'''{{Sfn|Groening|2010|pp=186, 1099, 1199}} is a recurring character in the [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[The Simpsons]].'' He is voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]].{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=1099}} Ralph is characterized largely by his frequent [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]] which range from nonsensical and bizarre to profound. His [[Stupidity|dim-witted]] behavior lends him an air of blissful ignorance.

The creator of the show, [[Matt Groening]], has cited Ralph as his favorite character.<ref>{{cite news | first = Eric | last = Moro | title = SDCC 07: The Simpsons Panel | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2007-07-28 | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/808/808965p1.html | access-date=2007-07-29}}</ref> He generally remains one of the more popular and often quoted secondary characters in the show. In 2006, ''[[IGN]]'' ranked Ralph No. 3 on their list of the "Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters," behind [[Sideshow Bob]] and [[Troy McClure]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Simpsons: Top 25 Peripheral Characters |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/16/the-simpsons-top-25-peripheral-characters |website=IGN|date=16 February 2012 }}</ref>

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Ralph is characterized as a slow-witted and good-natured 8-year-old boy in [[Lisa Simpson]]'s second-grade class,{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=186}} taught by [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Elizabeth Hoover|Ms. Hoover]]. Initially, he was mostly used as a silent background character without consistent characterization. However, in later seasons his role expanded, being a featured character in several episodes.

These episodes include: "[[I Love Lisa]]", an episode which set him apart from other tertiary characters and largely defined much of his character,<ref name=ilovelisa>{{cite episode |title=I Love Lisa|episode-link=I Love Lisa|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Frank Mula|Mula, Frank]]; [[Wes Archer|Archer, Wes]]|network=Fox |airdate=1993-02-11|season=04|number=15}}</ref> "[[This Little Wiggy]]" and "[[E Pluribus Wiggum]]"; as well as appearances both minor and prominent in many other episodes. Ralph also appears in various other media, such as the [[Simpsons Comics|Simpsons comic book series by Bongo]], and has even received his own entry in [[List of The Simpsons books|The Simpsons Library of Wisdom]] series.

===Personality===

Ralph's primary role in the show is to deliver clueless asides and odd ''[[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]].'' Ralph is presented as quite stupid, dumb, verbally challenged, and slow. In one of his most famous quotes, Ralph responds to the news that he is failing English class with the retort: "Me fail English? That's unpossible!"<ref name=lisaonice>{{cite episode |title=Lisa on Ice|episode-link=Lisa on Ice|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Mike Scully|Scully, Mike]]; [[Bob Anderson (director)|Anderson, Bob]]|network=Fox |airdate=1994-11-13|season=06|number=8}}</ref>

In other instances, Ralph has been shown to speak with relative ease, notably in "[[I Love Lisa]]" when he gives an uncharacteristically powerful performance as [[George Washington]] in a school play. Occasionally, Ralph has been used to break the [[fourth wall]] straightforwardly.<ref>Spoiler-centric events near the end of the game involving Ralph.{{cite video game|title=The Simpsons Game|developer=EA Redwood Shores, Rebellion, Amaze Entertainment |publisher=Electronic Arts|date=October 30, 2007<!-- (USA) -->|platform=Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, PlayStation Portable}}</ref>

Although it has never been explicitly stated in any ''Simpsons''-related media that Ralph is intellectually disabled and/or [[brain damage]]d,  [[Chief Wiggum]] drops baby Ralph in a flashback sequence, with the latter landing flat on his head. When Wiggum picks Ralph up again, Ralph suddenly has difficulty drinking out of his bottle.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Moms I'd Like to Forget]]".</ref>

==Creation and design==
Ralph was named after Ralph Kramden, the character on ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' portrayed by comedian [[Jackie Gleason]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Larry Carroll |date=2007-07-26 |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |publisher=[[MTV]] |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218115716/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 18, 2007 |access-date=2007-07-29}}</ref><ref name="sprcon" /> Ralph's first credited appearance in the show was in the episode "[[Moaning Lisa (The Simpsons)|Moaning Lisa]]", where he was considerably different in appearance and behavior. Ralph's modern design first appeared in the second-season episode "[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]". Early Ralph spoke with a voice similar to that of [[Nelson Muntz]]'s until Cartwright settled into his higher-pitched whine. Originally intended to be a "Mini-Homer," Ralph eventually took on a life of his own.<ref name=Jean>{{cite video|people=Jean, Al|year=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode 'Moaning Lisa'|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="sprcon">{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |last2=Klickstein |first2=Mathew |title=Springfield confidential: jokes, secrets, and outright lies from a lifetime writing for the Simpsons |date=2018 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0062748034 |page=105|location=New York City}}</ref> The staff later retconned Ralph into the son of [[Chief Wiggum]], a fact initially hinted at in "[[Kamp Krusty]]" and later made canon in "[[I Love Lisa]]".<ref name=tvguide>{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|date=2000-10-21|work=[[TV Guide]]|author=Joe Rhodes}}</ref>  Groening considers Ralph "really hard to write."<ref name=tvguide/>

Ralph's normal attire usually consists of a blue long-sleeve shirt with a collar, a belt with a red buckle, and brown pants. However, almost all ''Simpsons-''related media and merchandise portray Ralph with white or light gray colored pants. Ralph's hair is meant to evoke a [[Bowl cut|bowl-cut]] style.<ref name=thesimpsonshandbook>{{Cite book| last1 =Grau | first1 =Doris | last2=Mitzman Gaven | first2= Marcia | title =The Simpsons Handbook: Secret Tips from the Pros | publisher =[[HarperPaperbacks]]| year =2007 | isbn =978-0-06-123129-2| title-link =List of The Simpsons books#2000s }}</ref> In one particular issue of the comic book, Ralph is drawn in a realistic style, depicted with blonde hair.<ref name=thoh1>{{cite comic | writer=[[Mark Hamill|Hamill, Mark]] | artist=[[Bill Morrison (comics)|Morrison, Bill]] | title=Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror, "Catastrophe in Substitute Springfields" | issue=7 | date=September 2001 | publisher=[[Bongo Comics]]}}</ref> Adult Ralph in "[[Bart to the Future]]" has light brown hair.

==Reception==
Ralph has become one of the show's most popular characters. He is commonly featured on media and merchandise related to the show, including the [[The Simpsons season 13|season 13]] home media box set. [[Kidrobot]] released Ralph as a separate figure from the rest of their ''Simpsons'' line of figurines in 2009. The figure is twice as large as the others. The comedy band [[Bloodhound Gang|The Bloodhound Gang]] made a song titled "Ralph Wiggum" on the album ''[[Hefty Fine]],'' dedicated to the character and composed solely of some of his most famous quotes for lyrics. Show creator [[Matt Groening]] has stated that writers will most likely take credit for Ralph when someone asks who writes specific characters, which is a common misconception about the writing process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47771/3 |title=Matt Groening {{!}} The A.V.
