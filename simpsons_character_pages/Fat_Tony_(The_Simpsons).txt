'''Don Marion Anthony''' "'''Fat Tony'''" '''D'Amico''' is the name of two recurring characters in the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Both are voiced by [[Joe Mantegna]] and first appeared in the episode "[[Bart the Murderer]]" of the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]].<ref name=murderer>Jean, Al (2003). Commentary for "[[Bart the Murderer]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Fat Tony is a [[Gangster|mobster]] and the [[underboss]] of the [[Springfield Mafia]]. His henchmen include [[Legs and Louie|Legs, Louie]], and [[Johnny Tightlips]], and he reports to [[Don Vittorio DiMaggio]]. Upon the death of the original Fat Tony in the episode "[[Donnie Fatso]]" of the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|twenty-second season]], the character's near-identical cousin of the same name is introduced. The characters somewhat resemble real-life mobster [[Anthony Salerno|Anthony "Fat Tony" Salerno]].

==Profile==
===First Fat Tony===
The original Fat Tony, full name '''Marion Anthony D'Amico''', was the chief racketeer behind several of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s criminal enterprises, covering a wide range of [[racket (crime)|rackets]] which included [[illegal gambling]], [[cigarette smuggling]], [[rum-running|bootlegging]], [[fraud]], and making and selling [[fake ID]]s. In "[[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]", [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] contracts with the mafia to drive out [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s rival snack food distributors. Fat Tony took out a hit on [[Mayor Quimby]] in "[[Mayored to the Mob]]" in retaliation for a raid on their rat milk facility, which Quimby opposed, as they had promised him "dog or higher". Fat Tony puts out a contract on Homer after his private security business interferes with the mob's interests in "[[Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge]]". Homer would have been executed gangland-style if not for [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] coming to the rescue with her rifle. Fat Tony's son Michael is first mentioned by Fat Tony as he is talking to Marge in "[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]]", saying she drove him home from school sometimes. He is then properly introduced in the episode "[[The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer]]". The episode also reveals that Fat Tony's wife "was whacked by 'natural causes'." Fat Tony and his associates meet in what is known as the "Legitimate Businessman's Social Club". Fat Tony played the [[violin]] in "[[Insane Clown Poppy]]".

===Second Fat Tony===
The original Fat Tony dies in the twenty-second season episode "[[Donnie Fatso]]" from a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]], with his final words to Homer being "I loved you man." Shortly afterwards, he is replaced by his slimmer cousin '''Anthony Paul D'Amico''', initially nicknamed "Fit Tony".{{efn|The second Fat Tony's full name was revealed in the episode "[[Whistler's Father]]."}} By the end of that episode, Tony has taken to [[stress eating]] as a way of dealing with the numerous attempts on his life, and the resulting weight gain causes a change of nickname to "Fit-Fat Tony" and eventually "Fat Tony", essentially restoring the status quo from before the first Fat Tony died. This iteration of Fat Tony, although similar in character to the original, does have notable differences in his appearance such as lighter skin, darker hair, and wearing a red polo shirt instead of a teal one.

In "[[The Real Housewives of Fat Tony]]", he supposedly marries [[Selma Bouvier]], but the relationship falls apart when Selma discovers Tony only held a ceremony to make her his [[mistress (lover)|goomar]] as he is already married to another woman.

==Name==
[[File:Paul Sorvino.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Fat Tony's visual appearance was modeled after actor [[Paul Sorvino]].]]

The original Fat Tony's actual name is the source of some dispute, as several different real names have been revealed over the course of the series. In the third-season episode "[[Bart the Murderer]]", Fat Tony is referred to in a news report given by [[Kent Brockman]] as '''William''' "'''Fat Tony'''" '''Williams''', presumably an alias. In the eighth-season episode "[[The Homer They Fall]]", the announcer at Homer's boxing match against [[Drederick Tatum]] refers to Fat Tony as '''Anthony D'Amico''' (incidentally the name of one of the three Re-Recording Mixers in the end credits), which he is called later as well, for example, by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. In the twelfth-season episode "Insane Clown Poppy", [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Frankie the Squealer|Frankie the Squealer]] claims that Fat Tony's first name is '''Marion''', a reference to actor [[John Wayne]]'s real name, Marion Robert Morrison.<ref>(2009).

==Character==
===Development===
[[File:JoeMantegnaMay08.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Joe Mantegna]] was cast as Fat Tony because [[Sheldon Leonard]] was unavailable.]]

Fat Tony first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]] episode "Bart the Murderer".<ref name=murderer/> The writers conceived the episode before the film ''[[Goodfellas]]'', which has a similar plot, was released. However, when it was, the writers incorporated references to the film in the episode.<ref name=murderer/> Fat Tony was modeled on [[Paul Sorvino]], who played mobster [[Paul Vario|Paul Cicero]] in ''Goodfellas''.<ref name=murderer/> The appearance of [[Springfield Mafia#Legs and Louie|Louie]], one of Tony's henchmen, was based on another ''Goodfellas'' actor, [[Frank Sivero]].<ref>Moore, Rich (2003). Commentary for "[[Bart the Murderer]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The end of the episode portrays a TV movie about the events depicted in the episode, in which Joe Mantegna will play Fat Tony (this was before it was decided that Fat Tony would be a recurring character). In the episode "Donnie Fatso", Fat Tony dies of a heart attack; his cousin Fit Tony takes his place as head of the syndicate, but soon becomes known as Fat Tony due to stress-induced overeating.

===Voice===
The writers originally wanted [[Sheldon Leonard]] to voice Fat Tony. When they were unable to get him, they cast [[Joe Mantegna]].<ref name=murderer/> It is his longest-running role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Liz|title=Catching Up with Joe Mantegna|work=washingtonpost.com|date=2007-05-25|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/celebritology/2007/05/catching_up_with_joe_mantegna.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519105302/http://voices.washingtonpost.com/celebritology/2007/05/catching_up_with_joe_mantegna.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 19, 2011|access-date=2008-12-10}}</ref> Mantegna said, "You feel honored that they asked you to do a voice.

This is adhered to in the [[The Simpsons (season 20)|season 20]] episode "[[Sex, Pies, and Idiot Scrapes]], where the script required only grunting. Despite this, [[Phil Hartman]] voiced the character in the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season 7]] episode "[[A Fish Called Selma]]".<ref name=murderer/><ref>Goldblum, Jeff; Oakley, Bill; Silverman, David; Weinstein, Josh (2005).
