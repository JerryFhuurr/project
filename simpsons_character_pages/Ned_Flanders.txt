'''Nedward''' "'''Ned'''" '''Flanders Jr.''',{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=606}} commonly referred to by his surname, is a recurring character in the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=1105}} and first appearing in the series premiere episode "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]." He is the good-natured, cheery next-door neighbor to the [[Simpson family]] and is generally loathed by [[Homer Simpson]], though there are numerous instances where the two are portrayed as good friends. A scrupulous and devout [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]], he is among the friendliest and most compassionate of Springfield's residents and is generally considered a pillar of the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield community]].

He was one of the first characters outside the immediate Simpson family to appear on the show, and has since been central to several episodes, the first being [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]]'s "[[Dead Putting Society]]". As the series progressed, Flanders's [[religious fanaticism]] increased immensely, prompting the coining of the term "[[Flanderization]]". His last name comes from [[Ned Flanders Crossing|Flanders Street]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], the hometown of ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]].

===Development===

Ned Flanders' religion was not mentioned in his first few appearances and in the first few seasons he was only mildly religious and his primary role was to be so "cloyingly perfect as to annoy and shame the Simpsons", whereas [[Homer Simpson]] has always hated Ned Flanders and always tries to undermine him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Chris |author-link=Chris Turner (author) |others=Foreword by [[Douglas Coupland]] |year=2004 |title=Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation |title-link=Planet Simpson |edition=1st |publisher=Random House Canada |location=Toronto |oclc=55682258 |isbn=978-0-679-31318-2 |pages=270–271}}</ref> There has been a consistent effort among the show's writers to make him not just a "goody good and an unsympathetic person".<ref name="JeanDPS" /> In the later seasons, Flanders has become more of a caricature of the [[Christian right]], and his role as a "perfect neighbor" has been lessened.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=270–271}} For example, in some recent episodes Flanders has appeared to show rather prejudiced attitudes towards women, non-whites, homosexuals and people of religions other than Christianity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/simpsons-ned-flanders-worst-things/|title=The Simpsons: 10 Worst Things Ned Flanders Ever Did|date=November 2, 2019|website=ScreenRant}}</ref> Though he only ever showed homophobic signs in [[Canon (fiction)|non-canon]] episodes, notably "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV#Frinkenstein|Frinkenstein]]" where he says "I'm running to find a cure for homosexuality".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Steinberg|first1=Nick|title=The Simpsons: 10 Worst Things Ned Flanders Ever Did |publisher=ScreenRant|url=https://screenrant.com/simpsons-ned-flanders-worst-things/ |date=November 1, 2019 }}</ref>

Commentary for "[[When Flanders Failed]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> It was suggested by [[George Meyer]],<ref name="ReissWFF">Reiss, Mike (2003).

Commentary for "[[When Flanders Failed]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref>

There have been at least two occasions where Ned was not voiced by [[Harry Shearer]]. In "[[Bart of Darkness]]", Flanders's high pitched scream was performed by [[Tress MacNeille]]<ref name=Groening>Groening, Matt (2005). Commentary for "[[Bart of Darkness]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [[DVD]]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> and in "[[Homer to the Max]]", Flanders comments about cartoons being easily able to change voice actors and on that occasion he was voiced by [[Karl Wiedergott]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martyn |first1=Warren |last2=Wood |first2=Adrian |year=2000 |title=Homer to the Max |publisher=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season10/page12.shtml |access-date=October 31, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230082106/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season10/page12.shtml |archive-date=December 30, 2007}}</ref>

===''The Adventures of Ned Flanders''===
''The Adventures of Ned Flanders'' was a "series" of [[animated short|shorts]] starring Flanders, but only one episode, "Love that God", was produced. It appears at the end of the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]] episode "[[The Front (The Simpsons)|The Front]]"<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Front|episode-link=The Front (The Simpsons)|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Lapidus, Adam I.; Moore, Rich|network=Fox |airdate=1993-04-15 |season=04 |number=19}}</ref> because the episode was too short and the producers had already tried "every trick in the book" to lengthen it.<ref name="ReissTF">Reiss, Mike (2004). Commentary for "[[The Front]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Although the episode was scripted by [[Adam I. Lapidus]], "Love That God" was written by [[Mike Reiss]], [[Al Jean]] and [[Sam Simon]].<ref name="JeanTF">Jean, Al (2004). Commentary for "[[The Front]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> In the 34-second-long segment, which comes complete with its own theme song, Ned walks into Rod and Todd's room as they are praying and tells them it is time for church. He is upset when Todd replies that they are not going, until Todd reminds him it is Saturday, and Ned laughs at his mistake.<ref name="auto"/>

Most fans were confused by the short,<ref name="ReissTF" /> but [[Bill Oakley]] and several other writers loved it so much that they wanted to do more. Later, Oakley and [[Josh Weinstein]] decided to produce an entire episode that was nothing but loosely associated shorts, which became the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]] episode "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]".<ref name="Oakley22">Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for "[[22 Short Films About Springfield]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The Flanders/Lovejoy segment of that episode was written by [[David X.

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Ned is very honest and sincere in carrying out the Christian doctrines of charity, kindness, and compassion. He is frequently shown doing volunteer work, and is rigorously honest and upright, even going so far as to spend an entire day tracking down a [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#The Leftorium|Leftorium]] customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/11519923/The-Ned-Flanders-effect-why-God-just-isnt-sexy.html|title=The Ned Flanders effect: why God just isn't sexy|website=Telegraph.co.uk|date=April 8, 2015 |access-date=April 4, 2022}}</ref>

In "[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]", he donates a kidney and a lung out of the goodness of his heart to whoever needs them first. He also is a good neighbor to the Simpsons, regularly offering his assistance.<ref name="Lover">{{cite episode |title=Bart the Lover|episode-link=Bart the Lover|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Baeza, Carlos|network=Fox |airdate=1992-02-13 |season=03 |number=16}}</ref> Ned's dogged friendship inspires the loyalty of others; when his Leftorium shop appeared on the verge of bankruptcy shortly after it opened, Homer arranged a bailout with the help of many people in Springfield.<ref name="Failed" /> Despite a meek outward appearance, Ned hides an exceptionally well-toned physique.

===The Simpsons' good neighbor===
In the early years of ''The Simpsons'', Homer Simpson generally loathed Ned, because Ned's family, job, health and self-discipline are of higher quality than he could ever hope to attain himself.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Dead Putting Society|episode-link=Dead Putting Society|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Moore, Rich|network=Fox |airdate=2003-03-02 |season=02 |number=06}}</ref> Homer is often shown "borrowing" (stealing) items from Flanders, such as a [[weather vane]], a [[camcorder]], a diploma, a [[toothbrush]] and an [[air conditioning]] unit. Even the Simpsons' couch came from "the curb outside Flanders' house".
Homer has since come to have a [[Love–hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] with Ned, sometimes being his best friend, partly due to Ned's selfless tolerance of him, and other times treating Ned with complete disregard.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer Loves Flanders|episode-link=Homer Loves Flanders|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Richardson, David; Archer, Wes|network=Fox |airdate=1994-03-17 |season=05 |number=16}}</ref> Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing.<ref name="Alone" /> Nowadays Homer seems to regard Ned as more of a nuisance. An early running joke was that [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] considers Flanders to be a perfect neighbor,<ref name="Failed" /> and usually sides with him instead of her husband, which always [[Do-gooder derogation|enrages Homer.]]<ref name="JeanBtL" /> In "[[Left Behind (The Simpsons)|Left Behind]]," Homer succinctly states, "[Flanders] makes me feel so damn guilty!"

===Religiosity===
[[File:FlandersDevil.png|right|thumb|Flanders as the devil in "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]", portrayed as such due to being "the one you least suspect"]]
Ned Flanders is genuinely well-meaning and good-natured, one of the few such people in Springfield. Firmly religious, sometimes even being portrayed as an overly friendly people person. He can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]<ref>{{cite episode |title=Home Away from Homer|episode-link=Home Away from Homer |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Cohen, Joel H.|network=Fox |airdate=2005-05-15 |season=16 |number=12}}</ref> and a devout [[Evangelical Christian]] who strictly follows the [[Bible]] [[Biblical literalism|literally]] and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. This causes frequent calls to [[Reverend Lovejoy]], even over minuscule things, to the point that Lovejoy has stopped caring<ref name="Trust">{{cite episode |title=In Marge We Trust|episode-link=In Marge We Trust |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Cary, Donick; Moore, Steven Dean|network=Fox |airdate=1997-04-27 |season=08 |number=22}}</ref> and has even suggested that Flanders try a different religion.<ref name=Homediddly>{{cite episode |title=Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily|episode-link=Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Dietter, Susie|network=Fox |airdate=1995-10-01 |season=07 |number=03}}</ref> This was a running joke in the early seasons, but has been used less in the later episodes.<ref name="JeanBtL">Jean, Al (2003). Commentary for "[[Bart the Lover]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> In the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth season]], the episode "[[In Marge We Trust]]" would examine the relationship between Lovejoy and Flanders, and shows the history of their relationship and how Lovejoy became increasingly uninterested in Flanders' problems.<ref name="Trust" /> Flanders is shown to have a room in his house filled with memorabilia of [[The Beatles]]. He claims that this is because they were "[[More popular than Jesus|bigger than Jesus]]".<ref>{{cite episode|title=Bart of War|episode-link=The Bart of War|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Wilmore, Marc; Polcino, Michael|network=Fox |airdate=2003-05-18 |season=14 |number=21}}</ref>

===Family and job===
Ned is a widower, having been married to the equally religious [[Maude Flanders|Maude]]. They had two children together, the sheltered and naïve [[Rod Flanders|Rod]] and [[Todd Flanders]]. In the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|eleventh season]] episode "[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]", Maude died an untimely death in a freak accident involving a [[T-shirt cannon]], leaving Flanders alone and grieving.<ref name="Alone">{{cite episode |title=Alone Again, Natura-Diddily|episode-link=Alone Again, Natura-Diddily|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Maxtone-Graham, Ian; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=2000-02-13 |season=11 |number=14}}</ref> While still married to Maude, Ned married Ginger, while on a drunken bender in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].<ref name="Viva" /> Ginger came to live with Ned and his sons for a brief period following Maude's death in a later episode, but she quickly grew tired of the Flanders' sickly-sweet personalities and fled.  Despite his outward nerdishness, Flanders has also been connected romantically with a beautiful [[Christian rock|Christian-rock]] singer, [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Rachel Jordan|Rachel Jordan]],<ref name="Alone" /> movie star Sara Sloane and eventually marrying local teacher [[Edna Krabappel]] until she died as well.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Star Is Born-Again|episode-link=A Star Is Born Again|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Kelley, Brian; Marcantel, Michael|network=Fox |airdate=2003-03-02 |season=14 |number=13}}</ref>

[[File:Flanders with Parents.png|left|thumb|200px|A young Ned seen with his [[beatnik]] parents]]

Ned got his diploma from [[Oral Roberts University]] in an unspecified field and worked as a salesman in the [[pharmaceuticals]] industry for the bulk of his adult life. Having saved much of his earnings, Flanders decided to quit his job and invested his family's life savings into a store in the Springfield mall called the Leftorium specializing in products for left-handed people.<ref name="Failed">{{cite episode |title=When Flanders Failed|episode-link=When Flanders Failed|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Reardon, Jim|network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-03 |season=03 |number=03}}</ref> In the fifth season episode, "[[Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song]]", Superintendent Chalmers fires Ned Flanders, who has become principal after Skinner being sacked, only because he freely expresses his religious views in the school. However in the Season 29 episode "[[Left Behind (The Simpsons)|Left Behind]]", owing to declining sales, the Leftorium had been downsized from an outlet to a kiosk, eventually going out of business alongside the [[Sears]] outlet at Springfield Mall. Left unemployed, Flanders returned to Springfield Elementary School, finding a new job as Bart Simpson's new teacher and substituting the void left by his deceased second wife Edna Krabappel, as well as honoring her life dream.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/flanders-loses-his-faith-and-an-inconsequential-simpson-1825814494|title=Flanders loses his faith and an inconsequential Simpsons tests ours|first=Dennis|last=Perkins|website=[[The A.V.

In the episode "[[Hurricane Neddy]]" a flashback to 30 years earlier shows Ned as a young child, despite the fact that in the episode "[[Viva Ned Flanders]]" he says to the church congregation that he was actually 60 years old, attributing his youthful appearance to his conformity to the "three Cs"—"clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of vitamin church".<ref name="Viva">{{cite episode |title=Viva Ned Flanders|episode-link=Viva Ned Flanders|series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Stern, David M.; Affleck, Neil|network=Fox |airdate=1999-01-10 |season=10 |number=10}}</ref> Ned grew up in [[New York City]] and was the son of "freaky [[beatnik]]s" who did not discipline Ned (as they did not think it was right) and let him run wild. Eventually they took him to Dr. Foster, a psychiatrist, who put the young Ned through the [[University of Minnesota]] Spankalogical Protocol, which involved eight months of continuous spanking. The treatment worked so well that it rendered Flanders unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsensical jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper, causing Ned to unknowingly repress his anger.<ref name="Hurricane">{{cite episode |title=Hurricane Neddy|episode-link=Hurricane Neddy |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Young, Steve; Anderson, Bob|network=Fox |airdate=1996-12-29 |season=08 |number=08}}</ref>

=== Cultural impact ===
Flanders has been described as "The United States' most well-known evangelical".<ref name="US Catholic" /> According to ''[[Christianity Today]]'' in 2001, "on American college and high school campuses, the name most associated with the word Christian—other than Jesus—is not the [[Pope]] or [[Mother Teresa]] or even [[Billy Graham]]. Instead, it's a goofy-looking guy named Ned Flanders on the animated sitcom known as ''The Simpsons''.
