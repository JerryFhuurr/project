'''Doctor William <!-- Sean Moran -->MacDougal''',<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Lisa the Drama Queen |episode-link=Lisa the Drama Queen |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |season=2 |number=9 |time=14:27}}</ref> better known as '''Groundskeeper Willie''', is a recurring fictional character on ''[[The Simpsons]]'', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. He is the head [[groundskeeper]] and [[Janitor]] at [[Springfield Elementary School]]. Willie is almost [[feral]] in nature and is immensely proud of his Scottish origin. He is easily identifiable by his red hair and beard, as well as his aggressive temperament and thick, stereotypical [[Scottish English#Phonology|Scottish accent]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Willie is the groundskeeper and janitor at [[Springfield Elementary School]] and lives in a shack on the school premises. He is a Scotsman with an aggressive temper. Willie is an uncouth and unpleasant character, though essentially harmless. His personality is depicted as being incompetent, drunken, slow-witted, and quick to anger for little or no reason. Willie has shown antipathy to both his employer, [[Seymour Skinner|Principal Skinner]], and [[Bart Simpson]], who frequently plays practical jokes on him. In the alternate continuity of "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]", his spirit plots revenge on the students of Springfield Elementary after getting burned to death by their parents' actions.

Due to the deliberately inaccurate continuity of the series, he has claimed to be from various parts of Scotland during the series, most recently [[Kirkwall]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] in the 2012 episode '[[The Daughter Also Rises]]'. This settled the previous continuity problem in which Willie had been stated to be a supporter of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen F.C]], and to have lived in [[Glasgow]]. In early episodes, Willie's father was said to be dead. However, his parents were later introduced in "[[Monty Can't Buy Me Love]]", and lived near [[Loch Ness]]; which is near [[Inverness]]. In "[[The Girl Who Slept Too Little]]", it is revealed that he has a cousin, "Grave Digger Billy". In ''[[Dark Knight Court]]'' he describes himself as a "Scottish Old Believer Presbyterian" who "hates Easter" as some conservative [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] [[Easter#Non-observing Christian groups|reject Easter]] as a man-made feast on the basis of the [[regulative principle of worship]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Regulative Principle of Worship |url=https://www.fpchurch.org.uk/about-us/how-we-worship/the-regulative-principle-of-worship/ |publisher=[[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]] |access-date=21 March 2022}}</ref>

Willie plays a supporting role in most of his episodes, but he was a main character in the episode "[[My Fair Laddy]]", where [[Lisa Simpson]] introduced him to high culture as a science project.

In a [[running gag]] in each of the three segments of the episode "[[Treehouse of Horror V]]", Willie tries to help the main protagonists, but is struck in the back with an axe by a different character each time, a reference to [[Dick Halloran]]'s death in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', of which the first segment, "[[Treehouse of Horror V#The Shinning|The Shinning]]", is a direct parody.

Willie has a troubled and distant relationship with his parents. In the episode "My Fair Laddy", Willie recalls his birth and how his abusive father told him he would never amount to anything in life and would be lucky if he grew up to be "garbage".

On two occasions, Willie frames Bart for pulling pranks that Bart would normally pull. In "[[The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star]]", he unleashes a giant pie of rats on the Springfield Elementary medieval festival to get revenge for being cast as the [[village idiot]] and his cruel treatment. Skinner is quick to blame Bart and expels him. Willie is never shown being found out as the culprit, but it can be assumed that he is eventually found out after Bart is enrolled in Catholic school and earns his way back into Springfield Elementary. In "[[Dark Knight Court]]", Willie causes hundreds of eggs to be splattered at the Springfield Easter celebration out of inbred hatred for the holiday. Bart is put on trial for the incident, only to be acquitted when Willie is caught and turned in by Lisa and Mr. Burns (as Fruit Batman).

==Character==
[[File:Dan Castellaneta 2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Dan Castellaneta]], the voice of Groundskeeper Willie]]
Groundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in the season two episode "[[Principal Charming]]", first broadcast on February 14, 1991. Originally, the character was written as simply being an angry janitor; his Scottish accent was added during a recording session. [[Dan Castellaneta]], who voices several other characters including [[Homer Simpson]], was assigned to do the voice. Castellaneta did not know what voice to use and [[Sam Simon]], who was directing at the time, told Castellaneta to use an accent. He first tried a [[Spain|Spaniard]]'s voice, which Simon felt was too [[cliché]]d. He then tried a "big dumb [[Sweden|Swede]]", which was also rejected. For his third attempt, he used the voice of an angry Scotsman, which was considered to be more appropriate and was used in the episode.<ref name="Reiss">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 videocassette commentary for the episode "Principal Charming"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref><ref name="sprcon">{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |last2=Klickstein |first2=Mathew |title=Springfield confidential: jokes, secrets, and outright lies from a lifetime writing for the Simpsons |date=2018 |publisher=Dey Street Books |isbn=978-0062748034 |page=104|location=New York City}}</ref> Originally thought by the directors to be a one-off appearance, Willie has since become a recurring character.<ref name="Kirkland">{{cite video | people=Kirkland, Mark|date=2002|title=The Simpsons season 2 DVD commentary for the episode "Principal Charming"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> [[Matt Groening]] later revealed that the character was based partially on Angus Crock, a [[kilt]]-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show ''[[Second City Television]]'', who was portrayed by [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]<ref name="SoS">{{cite news | url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/thesimpsons/Groening-lifts-toilet-lid-on.3308980.jp | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130202032609/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/thesimpsons/Groening-lifts-toilet-lid-on.3308980.jp | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 2, 2013 | title=Groening lifts toilet lid on the real-life Groundskeeper Willie | publisher=[[Scotland on Sunday]] | date=July 21, 2007 | first=Marc | last=Horne | access-date=2007-08-02 }}</ref> and [[Jimmy Finlayson]], the moustachioed [[Scotland|Scottish]] actor who appeared in 33 [[Laurel and Hardy]] films.<ref name="doh">{{cite news|first=Jeremy|last=Simon|title=Wisdom from The Simpsons' 'D'ohh' boy|publisher=The Daily Northwestern|date=1994-02-11|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In September 2014, Groundskeeper Willie featured in an official video in which he endorsed a vote for [[Scottish independence]] in an [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|upcoming Scottish referendum]], and put himself forward to lead a potentially independent Scotland while standing in front of the [[Flag of Scotland|St. Andrew's Cross]] with a tattoo on his chest that read: 'Aye or Die!'.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Davies Boren|first1=Zachary|title=Groundskeeper Willie declares support for Scottish independence, volunteers to lead the new country|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-independence/groundskeeper-willie-declares-support-for-scottish-independence-volunteers-to-lead-the-new-country-9731930.html|access-date=27 July 2020|work=[[The Independent]]|date=14 September 2014}}</ref> Following the result of the referendum where the Scottish electorate voted to remain as part of the [[UK]], the producers released an image of Willie now standing in front of a [[Union Jack]] flag, looking depressed with his "Aye or Die!" tattoo replaced with a picture of [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] and empty bottles of [[whisky]] with a newspaper featuring Former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]], who was widely credited with giving the "No" campaign a last-minute boost.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/see-groundskeeper-willie-simpsons-gutted-4295952 | title=The Simpsons Groundskeeper Willie gutted after Scots 'No' vote| website=[[Daily Mirror]]| date=2014-09-20}}</ref>

===Reception===
In 2006, Groundskeeper Willie was named the fourth-best peripheral character in the history of the show by [[IGN]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p5.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031112102/http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730957p5.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 31, 2007|title=Top 25 Simpsons Peripheral Characters|access-date=2007-06-08|date=2006-09-06|author1=Eric Goldman |author2=Dan Iverson |author3=Brian Zoromski |publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref> who said "high-points for the character were being trained to be civilized, wrestling a wolf that was let loose in the school and becoming a substitute for the French language teacher – 'Bon jourrr! You cheese-eating surrender monkeys!'" IGN also named "[[My Fair Laddy]]", the only episode which centres around Willie, the best episode of the seventeenth season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/731/731095p3.html|title=The Simpsons: 17 Seasons, 17 Episodes|author1=Goldman, Eric |author2=Dan Iverson, Brian Zoromski |publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2006-09-08|access-date=2007-08-02}}</ref> Jim Slotek of [[Sun Media]] called Willie the ninth-best ''Simpsons'' supporting character, and also made a Top Ten quotes list, which included Willie's quote "Och, back to the loch wi' ye, [[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]]", from "[[Selma's Choice]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/2007/07/22/4358557-sun.html|title='Simpsons' makes jump to big screen|author=Slotek, Jim|publisher=[[Sun Media]]|access-date=2007-08-02|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130115104310/http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/2007/07/22/4358557-sun.html|archive-date=2013-01-15}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' reported in late-2005 that "he is the most instantly recognisable Scot in the world: better known than [[Billy Connolly]] or [[Ewan McGregor]], even [[Sean Connery]]."
