'''Homer Jay Simpson''' is the main [[protagonist]] of the American animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Part of the [[Simpson family|titular family]], Homer made his television debut in the [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]" on ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] crafted and designed Homer while waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. Initially called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'', Groening instead developed a new set of characters. After two years on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family [[Spinoff (media)|received their own series]], which premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on December 17, 1989.

Homer is the patriarch of the family; he is married to [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], with whom he has three children, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's primary provider, Homer primarily works as a safety inspector at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. He represents numerous [[American working-class]] stereotypes: he is overweight, balding, immature, unintelligent, outspoken, aggressive, lazy, ignorant, unprofessional, and deeply fond of beer, junk food, and television. Despite these flaws, Homer is fundamentally a kind-hearted man and fiercely protective of his family, particularly during crucial moments.

In the short films and early episodes of ''The Simpsons'', [[Dan Castellaneta]] voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]. However, starting with the [[The Simpsons season 2|second season]] of the full-length series, Homer's voice transformed into a stronger tone to effectively express a wider range of emotions. Homer has also been featured in various Simpsons-related media, such as [[List of The Simpsons video games|video games]], ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' (2007), [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]], commercials, and [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]], and has sparked a wide array of merchandise. His iconic catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", has been recognized in linguistics, appearing in ''[[The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.

Homer is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential television characters of all time and is widely recognized as an American [[cultural icon]]. In 2007, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked Homer ninth on their list of the "50 Greatest TV Icons," and in 2010, placed him first on their list of the "Top 100 Characters of the Past Twenty Years". ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' referred to him as "the greatest comic creation of [modern] time",<ref name="m233"/> while [[TV Guide]], in 2002, referred to him as the second-greatest cartoon character (after [[Bugs Bunny]]). Castellaneta has received four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]], along with a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and the family were honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

''The Simpsons'' employs a [[floating timeline]], where characters either do not age or age minimally. Therefore, the show is always assumed to be set in the current [[year]]. {{sfn|Friedrich|Colmenares|2017|p=73}}{{Sfn|Davis|Gilboy|Zborowski|2015|pp=175–188}} Despite the show's flexible timeline, several episodes link events in Homer's life to specific time periods.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78–79}} In "[[Mother Simpson]]" ([[The Simpsons season 7|season seven]], 1995), Homer's mother, Mona, is portrayed as a radical who went into hiding in 1969 after a run-in with the law.<ref name=MotherSimpson>{{cite episode |title=Mother Simpson |episode-link=Mother Simpson |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Richard Appel|Appel, Rich]]; [[David Silverman (animator)|Silverman, David]] |network=Fox |airdate=November 19, 1995 |season=7 |number=8}}</ref> "[[The Way We Was]]" ([[The Simpsons season 2|season two]], 1991) depicts Homer falling in love with Marge as a senior at Springfield High School in 1974.<ref name=WayWeWas>{{cite episode |title=The Way We Was |episode-link=The Way We Was |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Reiss, Mike]]; [[Sam Simon|Simon, Sam]]; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=January 31, 1991 |season=2 |number=12}}</ref> Similarly, "[[I Married Marge]]" ([[The Simpsons season 3|season three]], 1991) implies that Marge became pregnant with Bart in 1980.<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episode-link=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jeffrey Lynch|Lynch, Jeffrey]] |network=Fox |airdate=December 26, 1991 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> However, "[[That '90s Show (The Simpsons)|That '90s Show]]" ([[The Simpsons season 19|season 19]], 2008) contradicts these events, depicting Homer and Marge as a twentysomething, childless couple in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=That '90s Show |episode-link=That '90s Show (The Simpsons) |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Matt Selman|Selman, Matt]] (writer); [[Kirkland, Mark]] (director)|network=Fox |airdate=January 27, 2008 |season=19 |number=11}}</ref> This inconsistency deepens in "[[Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars]]" ([[The Simpsons season 32|season 32]], 2021), which reimagines Homer's adolescence as occurring in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars |episode-link=Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Michael Price (writer)|Price, Michael]] (writer); Moeller, Jennifer (director)|network=Fox |airdate=March 14, 2021|season=32|number=15}}</ref> Showrunner [[Matt Selman]] has addressed these contradictions, stating that no version is "official continuity" and that "they all kind of happened in their imaginary world", allowing viewers to choose the version they prefer.<ref name="b283">{{cite web | last=Bailey | first=Kat | title=''The Simpsons'': Matt Selman On Continuity And His Support For a ''Simpsons'' Hit & Run Remake | website=[[IGN]] | date=July 28, 2021 | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake | access-date=January 3, 2025}}</ref>

Homer's age has fluctuated throughout ''The Simpsons'' due to its floating timeline. In the early episodes, he was thirty-four, increasing to thirty-six in season four, thirty-eight and thirty-nine in season eight, and forty by season eighteen, though these ages are inconsistent even within those seasons.<ref name="n649">{{cite web | last=Tyler | first=Adrienne | title=''The Simpsons'': How Old Homer Is (& How His Age Has Changed) | website=[[Screen Rant]] | date=October 14, 2020 | url=https://screenrant.com/simpsons-show-homer-age-how-old/ | access-date=January 3, 2025}}</ref> In the episode "[[Duffless]]" ([[The Simpsons season 4|season four]], 1993), Homer's driver's license lists his birthdate as May 12, 1956, making him 36 at the time.<ref name="Duffless">{{cite AV media|title=''The Simpsons'': The Complete Fourth Season (DVD)|date=2004|people=[[Reiss, Mike]]; [[Al Jean|Jean, Al]] (writers); [[Jim Reardon|Reardon, Jim]] (director)|publisher=Fox|chapter=Commentary for "[[Duffless]]"}}</ref> During [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]]'s tenure as showrunners, they aged Homer to thirty-eight, reflecting their own aging and perception of the character.<ref name="n649"/> According to the [[The Simpsons episode guides|episode guides]] ''The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family'' (1997) and ''Simpsons World: The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1–20'' (2010), both authored by Groening, Homer's official age is 36.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Groening|2010|p=14}} Homer stands {{convert|6|ft|2}} tall and weighs between 239 and 260&nbsp;lbs (108{{En dash}}120&nbsp;kg).{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Groening|2010|p=14}}

=== Character development ===
Executive producer [[Al Jean]] observes that in ''The Simpsons'' writers' room, "everyone loves writing for Homer", with many of his antics inspired by the writers' own experiences.<ref>{{cite news|first=Todd|last=Leopold|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/13/simpsons.300/index.html|title=The Simpsons Rakes in the D'oh!|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=February 13, 2003|access-date=September 10, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210182915/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/13/simpsons.300/index.html|archive-date=December 10, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> In the show's early seasons, Bart was the main character, but by the [[The Simpsons season 4|fourth season]], Homer took on a more prominent role. Groening explained this shift: "With Homer, there's just a wider range of jokes you can do. And there are far more drastic consequences to Homer's stupidity. There's only so far you can go with a juvenile delinquent. We wanted Bart to do anything up to the point of him being tried in court an adult. But Homer is an adult, and his boneheaded-ness is funnier. [...] Homer is launching himself headfirst into every single impulsive thought that occurs to him".<ref name="EW 2010">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Snierson|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/09/simpsons-matt-groening-dan-castellaneta-greatest-character-homer-simpson/|title=''The Simpsons'': Matt Groening and Dan Castellaneta on EW's Greatest Character, Homer Simpson|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 9, 2010|access-date=September 7, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819172650/http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/09/simpsons-matt-groening-dan-castellaneta-greatest-character-homer-simpson/|archive-date=August 19, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Personality ===
The comedic appeal of Homer's character stems from his frequent displays of bumbling stupidity, laziness, and explosive temper. With a low intelligence level, director [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] has described him as "creatively brilliant in his stupidity".

===Analysis===
Homer is an "[[everyman]]" and embodies several American stereotypes of working class [[blue-collar]] men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, dim-witted, childish, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78–79}} Groening describes him as "completely ruled by his impulses".<ref>{{cite news |title=Person of the Week: Matt Groening |work=[[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] |date=July 27, 2007 |url=http://a.abcnews.go.com/WN/PersonOfWeek/story?id=3422830&page=1 |access-date=September 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723093621/http://a.abcnews.go.com/WN/PersonOfWeek/story?id=3422830&page=1 |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Castellaneta calls him "a dog trapped in a man's body", adding, "He's incredibly loyal—not entirely clean—but you gotta love him."<ref name="The Age"/>

In his book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', author [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] describes Homer as "the most American of the Simpsons" and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is "pure American".{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=80}} In the book ''God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture'', the authors comment that "Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly."{{sfn|Mazur |McCarthy|2001|p=[https://archive.org/details/godindetailsamer00mazu/page/243 243]}} The book ''[[The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer]]'' includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character from the perspective of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[virtue ethics]]. [[Raja Halwani]] writes that Homer's "love of life" is an admirable character trait, "for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality.&nbsp;... He is not [[politically correct]], he is more than happy to judge others, and he certainly does not seem to be obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable ''person'', but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world."<ref>[[#Halwani|Halwani]], pp. 22–23</ref> In 2008, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' justified designating ''The Simpsons'' as a television classic by stating, "we all hail Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is stunning".<ref>{{cite news|first1=Jennifer|last1=Armstrong|first2=Whitney|last2=Pastorek|first3=Dan|last3=Snierson|first4=Tim|last4=Stack|first5=Alynda|last5=Wheat|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2007/06/18/new-classics-tv|title=100 New TV Classics|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 18, 2007|access-date=September 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710094307/http://www.ew.com/article/2007/06/18/new-classics-tv|archive-date=July 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the [[The Simpsons season 8|season eight]] episode "[[Homer's Enemy]]" the writers decided to examine "what it would be like to actually work alongside Homer Simpson".<ref>{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Snierson|url=https://ew.com/article/2000/01/14/springfield-dreams/|title=Springfield of Dreams|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=January 14, 2000|access-date=September 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805160552/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275114,00.html|archive-date=August 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The episode explores the possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic named Frank Grimes placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99–106}}<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Josh Weinstein (writer)|chapter=Commentary for "[[Homer's Enemy]]"|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season (DVD)|date=2006|location=Los Angeles, California|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]}}</ref> By the end of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering "real American hero", has become the villain; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99–106}}

In ''Gilligan Unbound'', author [[Paul Arthur Cantor]] states that he believes Homer's devotion to his family has added to the popularity of the character. He writes, "Homer is the distillation of pure fatherhood.&nbsp;... This is why, for all his stupidity, bigotry and self-centered quality, we cannot hate Homer. He continually fails at being a good father, but he never gives up trying, and in some basic and important sense that makes him a good father."{{sfn|Cantor|2001|pp=74–76}} ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' remarked "Homer is good because, above all, he is capable of great love. When the chips are down, he always does the right thing by his children—he is never unfaithful in spite of several opportunities."<ref name=SundayTimes>{{cite news |first=Lindsay |last=McIntosh |url=https://www.thetimes.com/article/theres-nobody-like-him-except-you-me-everyone-6b05sctmwbh |title=There's nobody like him ... except you, me, everyone |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |publisher=Times Media Group |location=London, England |date=July 8, 2007 |access-date=September 21, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306043841/https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/theres-nobody-like-him-except-you-me-everyone-6b05sctmwbh |archive-date=March 6, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===D'oh!===
{{Main|D'oh!}}
Homer's main and most famous catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an "annoyed grunt".{{sfn|Reiss|Klickstein|2018|p=108}} Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by [[Jimmy Finlayson]], the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 [[Laurel and Hardy]] films.{{sfn|Reiss|Klickstein|2018|p=108}} Finlayson had used the term as a [[minced oath]] to stand in for the word "[[Damn]]!" [[Matt Groening]] felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered "D'oh!".<ref name=herald>{{Cite news |title=What's the story with ...
