He is the mascot and chief spokesperson for [[Duff Beer]]. It has been referenced, however, that the corporate mascot "Duffman" has actually been embodied by a number of different actors, though they are virtually identical. He is known for his staccato catchphrase: "Oh, yeah!" (also the character's unofficial [[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|theme song]]). He is recognizable by his "Duff"-branded cap, [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|wayfarer]] sunglasses, red cape, light blue [[bodysuit]], and utility belt stocked with "Duff".

==Profile==
Barry Huffman, better known as Duffman and voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], is a recurring character who, according to [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]], "embodies all the self-importance and over-statement of contemporary marketing."{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=172}} He is the mascot for the fictional Duff Corporation that sells [[Duff Beer]],<ref name=cochran>{{cite web|last=Cochran|first=Jennifer D.|title="Mmmm...

The Simpsons: The Complete Ninth Season|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> His catchphrase, "Oh, yeah!", is a nod to the [[Yello]] song "[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]", which many advertisers began to use when ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' made it a hit.<ref name="duffmancommentary" /> While loyal to his corporate sponsors, in the season 15 episode "[[Co-Dependents' Day]]", Duffman reveals he is ashamed of betraying his [[Jew]]ish heritage by doing a [[Nazi]]-esque performance at [[Oktoberfest]] ("This [[Reich]] will last a thousand beers! Oh, ''ja''! [muttering]: I do this, and I'm [[Jewish]]."). In the season 17 episode "[[Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play]]", it was revealed there were two other Duffmen working (but it is kept a secret so as not to disillusion children). "[[Jaws Wired Shut]]" revealed that all the actors who have played Duffman have died, a nod to the [[Marlboro Man#Smoking-related deaths|Marlboro Man]] deaths, ("Duffman can never die; only the actors who play him"), which sheds some light on the so-called continuity error in which Duffman was referred to as "Larry" in "[[Pygmoelian]]". Howard K. Duff called him "Sid", in "[[Hungry, Hungry Homer]]", and in "[[Old Yeller Belly]]", he self-identifies (while out of character) as "Barry Duffman". In "[[Waiting for Duffman]]", in which Duffman retires temporarily and is replaced by Homer, his name is Barry Huffman. The character has been portrayed as [[Jewish]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 20, 2019 |title='Simpsons' Writer Reveals Show's Jewish Bona Fides |url=https://www.jewishexponent.com/2019/03/20/simpsons-writer-reveals-shows-jewish-bona-fides/ |website=jewishexponent.com}}</ref>

Duffman's first appearance was in the ninth-season episode "[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]" in 1997.<ref name="duffmancommentary" /> Incidentally, a comic book character named "Duffman" was featured in the cover of the program for the 1994 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], drawn by Simpsons illustrators Steve Vance and [[Bill Morrison (comics)|Bill Morrison]].<ref name="tylersr">{{cite web|last=Tyler|first=Adrienne|title=The Simpson's Original Duffman Debuted Three Years Before The Proper One |url=https://screenrant.com/simpsons-duffman-debut-comic-before-show/ |website=[[Screen Rant]]|date=September 22, 2019 |access-date=September 22, 2019}}</ref>

There are also international, culture-specific versions of Duffman for the overseas markets. ''Duffmensch'', the German version of Duffman, wears a blue [[pickelhaube]] helmet and blue spandex [[lederhosen]] with a dark leather waistbelt with beer-can holders that look like ammunition pouches. He uses the German language slogan ''Oh Ja!''. The Canadian version of Duffman (seen on the label of ''Le Duff'', the Canadian version of Duff) wears a Mountie uniform and uses the French-language slogan ''Mais Oui!'' They are still played by the American Duffman and have his mannerisms.

==Production and reception==
Duffman's voice actor, Hank Azaria, has revealed that he "dreads" voicing the character, as it "will blow me out in a second" and "actually does hurt".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495853/the-simpsons-character-that-hank-azaria-actually-dreads-voicing|title=The Simpsons Character That Hank Azaria Actually Dreads Voicing|date=May 7, 2020|website=CINEMABLEND}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-actor-hank-azaria-says-he-insured-vocal-cords-scare-1293585|title='Simpsons' Actor Hank Azaria Says He Insured Vocal Cords After Scare|date=May 6, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

[[MLB]] player [[Matt Duffy]], nicknamed "Duffman", has had the character stenciled on his bats.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/sports/baseball/world-series-2014-a-giants-rookies-rise-just-a-bit-cartoonish-.html|title=A Giants Rookie's Rise, Just a Bit Cartoonish|date=October 25, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Crouse|first1=Karen|access-date=17 November 2023}}</ref>
