'''Santa's Little Helper''' is a fictional dog in the American [[Animated cartoon|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is the pet [[greyhound]] of the [[Simpson family]]. He was previously voiced by [[Frank Welker]], and is currently voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. The dog was introduced in the first episode of the show, the 1989 Christmas special "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]", in which his owner abandons him for finishing last in a [[Greyhound racing|greyhound race]]. [[Homer Simpson]] and his son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], who are at the race track in hope of winning some money for Christmas presents, see this and decide to adopt the dog.

Santa's Little Helper has since appeared frequently on ''The Simpsons'', and is the center of the plots of several episodes. During the course of the show, he has fathered litters of puppies, passed [[obedience school]], had surgery for [[gastric dilatation volvulus|bloat]], replaced [[Duffman]] as the mascot for [[Duff Beer]], and been trained as a police dog at [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s Animal Police Academy. Some of the episodes that focus on Santa's Little Helper have been inspired by popular culture or real experiences that staff members of the show have gone through.

Although most cartoon animals are often humanized,<ref name=Rabin /> Santa's Little Helper generally exhibits canine behavior. Santa's Little Helper has become a popular character following his appearances on ''The Simpsons''. He ranked 27th in [[Animal Planet]]'s 2003 television special ''50 Greatest TV Animals'' that was based on popularity, name recognition, and the longevity of the shows. He has also been featured in merchandise relating to ''The Simpsons'', such as video games, board games, and comics.

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Santa's Little Helper is a [[greyhound]] dog that appears on the animated television sitcom series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and is the pet dog of the [[Simpson family]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Highlights |newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=1992-03-12 |page=5E}}</ref> He can often be seen on the show in minor appearances, although there have been some episodes that feature him heavily, including the first episode of ''The Simpsons''. In that episode, "[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]" (season one, 1989), [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] discovers that he has no money to buy Christmas presents for the family. Desperate for a miracle, he and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] go to the [[greyhound racing]] track on [[Christmas Eve]] in hopes of winning some money. Although Homer has inside information on which dog is the most likely to win, he instead bets on a last-minute entry, Santa's Little Helper (here despite being brown), believing the dog's Christmas-inspired name to be a sign. However, the greyhound finishes last. As Homer and Bart leave the track, they watch the dog's owner abandon him for losing the race. Bart pleads with Homer to keep the dog as a pet and he agrees after it affectionately licks him on the cheek. When Bart and Homer return home, Santa's Little Helper is assumed by the rest of the family to be a Christmas present.<ref name="roasting">{{Cite episode |title=Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire |episode-link=Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=1989-12-17 |season=01 |number=01}}</ref> Years later, the family would find breeder and trainer Les Moore and reunite their pet with his mother She-Biscuit.<ref name="twotd">{{Cite episode |title=The Way of the Dog |episode-link=The Way of the Dog |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=2020-05-17 |season=31 |number=22}}</ref>

In various episodes, Santa's Little Helper can be seen chewing on newspapers and other objects in the Simpsons' household, destroying furniture, and digging holes in the backyard.<ref>{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |author-link=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperPerennial]] |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |isbn=978-0-06-095252-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/simpsonscomplete00groe/page/16 16] |ref={{harvid|Richmond & Coffman|1997}} |title-link=The Simpsons episode guides#The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family }}.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Santa's Little Helper |url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/bios/bios_family_santas.htm |publisher=TheSimpsons.com |access-date=2011-08-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520035907/http://www.thesimpsons.com/bios/bios_family_santas.htm |archive-date=2011-05-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In "[[Bart's Dog Gets an "F"]]{{-"}} (season two, 1991), he manages to infuriate the entire family by destroying valued items in the home. As a result, Homer and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] want to get rid of the dog, but Bart and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] convince them that he can be trained at an [[obedience school]]. Santa's Little Helper does not do well there as Bart is unwilling to use a choke chain suggested by the instructor. The night before the final exam, Bart and Santa's Little Helper play, thinking it will be their last few hours together. This bonding breaks down the communication barrier, allowing the dog to understand Bart's commands, and consequently pass the obedience school.<ref name="getsanF">{{Cite episode |title=Bart's Dog Gets an F |episode-link=Bart's Dog Gets an "F" |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=1991-03-07 |season=02 |number=16}}</ref>

Santa's Little Helper has fathered several puppies. In "[[Two Dozen and One Greyhounds]]" (season six, episode twenty, 1995), he runs away to the dog racing track where he mates with a female hound named She's the Fastest. She later gives birth to 25 puppies and when the Simpsons cannot take care of them any longer, they decide to sell them; however, [[Mr. Burns]] steals the puppies and decides to make a tuxedo out of them. Before he does this, however, he becomes emotionally touched by them. This convinces him to never wear fur again and instead raise the puppies to be world-class racing dogs.<ref name="twodozen">{{Cite episode |title=Two Dozen and One Greyhounds |episode-link=Two Dozen and One Greyhounds |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=1995-04-09 |season=06 |number=20}}</ref> Santa's Little Helper sires another litter of puppies with [[Julius Hibbert|Dr. Hibbert]]'s [[poodle]] in the episode "[[Today I Am a Clown]]" (season 15, 2003).

The dog has been neglected or treated unfavorably by the family in some episodes.<ref>{{cite news |last=Guzior |first=Betsey |title=Pulp fiction |newspaper=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]] |date=2002-06-14 |page=E3}}</ref> In "[[Dog of Death]]" (season three, 1992), he nearly dies of [[gastric dilatation volvulus|bloat]] and they decide to make budget cuts in order to pay for the required operation.

He ends up in the possession of Mr. Burns, who trains him to become a vicious attack dog. Several days later, Bart stumbles upon the trained Santa's Little Helper and is attacked, but the greyhound eventually recognizes his old friend and stops.<ref name="dogofdeath">{{Cite episode |title=Dog of Death |episode-link=Dog of Death |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=1992-03-12 |season=03 |number=19}}</ref> In "[[The Canine Mutiny]]" (season eight, 1997), Bart uses a fake [[charge card]] to buy a well-trained [[rough collie]] named Laddie from a mail-order catalog. Laddie learns many tricks that Santa's Little Helper is completely unable to perform, and the Simpson family nearly forgets about their old pet. Bart eventually gives Santa's Little Helper away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tries to get him back. When he finally finds him, Santa's Little Helper is serving as a seeing-eye dog for a blind man, but eventually decides to return to the family.<ref name="caninemutiny">{{Cite episode |title=The Canine Mutiny |episode-link=The Canine Mutiny |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=1997-04-13 |season=08 |number=20}}</ref>

In "[[Stop or My Dog Will Shoot]]" (season 18, 2007), Santa's Little Helper becomes a local hero after finding a lost Homer, and the Simpsons decide to enroll him in the Animal Police Academy. However, his new crime-fighting job makes him jaded and one day at home he bites Bart. The Simpsons must therefore send the dog away to live with officer [[Eddie and Lou|Lou]]. However, he gets to return after saving Bart from a toxic smoke cloud at school and then leaving the police force.<ref name="dogwillshoot">{{Cite episode |title=Stop or My Dog Will Shoot |episode-link=Stop or My Dog Will Shoot |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=2007-05-13 |season=18 |number=20}}</ref> In "[[How Munched is That Birdie in the Window?]]" (season 22, 2010), after Santa's Little Helper devours a pigeon with a broken leg that Bart was nursing, Bart gets mad at the dog and is unable to forgive him. The Simpsons therefore give him away to an ostrich farm. There, Bart says goodbye to him and explains that he should never, ever devour a bird. Bart then gets into a fight with an angry ostrich. After remembering that he was told that it's wrong to kill birds, he ceases to aid Bart in the fight, confused at his own loyalty (for Bart's sake or his orders) leaving Bart to strangle the ostrich. Bart then realizes that he could not help killing the pigeon and apologizes. Afterwards, the family goes back home with the dog.<ref name="birdiewindow">{{Cite episode |title=How Munched is That Birdie in the Window? |episode-link=How Munched is That Birdie in the Window? |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=2010-11-28 |season=22 |number=07}}</ref>

The dog once replaced [[Duffman]] as the mascot for [[Duff Beer]] in the episode "[[Old Yeller Belly]]" (season 14, 2003), after he was seen drinking from a can of beer by balancing it on his nose. He becomes known as Suds McDuff and boosts sales of Duff Beer, making the family's fortunes explode. However, this prompts his original sleazy owner and racing trainer to visit the Simpsons and prove that he's the owner of the dog. The family later figures that if they can get Duffman to replace Suds as the Duff mascot, they can get their dog back. They plan to turn Duffman into a hero at a Duff Beer-sponsored [[beach volleyball]] event; however, their plan fails and a drunk shark that's discovered at the event becomes the new mascot instead. Santa's Little Helper gladly returns to the Simpson family.<ref name="oldyeller">{{Cite episode |title=Old Yeller Belly |episode-link=Old Yeller Belly |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]] |airdate=2003-05-04 |season=14 |number=19}}</ref>

==Creation and development==
[[File:Matt Groening by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] prefers that animals in cartoons act realistically.]]
Santa's Little Helper's initial appearance on ''The Simpsons'' was in the first episode of the series, "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which aired on December 17, 1989.<ref name=tvguide/> Since then, he has become a recurring character. ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] told ''[[TV Guide]]'' in 2000 that "we [the staff] painted ourselves into a corner with our Christmas episode. Once we wrote the dog into the show, we were stuck with him."<ref name=tvguide>{{cite magazine |title=Flash! 24 Simpsons stars reveal themselves |date=2000-10-21 |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |author=Rhodes, Joe}}</ref> The name "Santa's Little Helper" was chosen because, according to writer [[Al Jean]] in the same ''TV Guide'' article, "we needed a name that would inspire Homer to bet on him, an omen, a Christmas name since he was betting on Christmas Eve. But, at that point, nobody was thinking long-term. We weren't considering what might happen in ten years, when we've got to use this name."<ref name=tvguide/> Although "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" was the first episode of the series to air on TV, it was the eighth episode produced by the staff. It was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with the others. Jean told the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' in 2001 that after the first episode was broadcast and "the next seven didn't have the dog, people wondered why."<ref>{{cite news |last=Westbrook |first=Bruce |title=Animated icons After a dozen seasons, Fox's 'The Simpsons' still has strange appeal |newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=2001-11-04 |page=11}}</ref> He also said in 2003 that the staff enjoyed the first episodes that centered on him, particularly "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which is the reason that more episodes about him were written.<ref name="Jean-dogofdeath"/>

Writer [[John Swartzwelder]] has noted that the staff members of the show write the character Homer in the same way that they write Santa's Little Helper: "Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food."<ref name=tvguide/> Although animals in cartoons often behave with "semi-human awareness", Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly the way they do in real life. As a result, Santa's Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show.<ref name="Groening">{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season ''DVD commentary for the episode "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds"'' |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, but most of the time the staff of ''The Simpsons'' tries to keep animals acting realistically.<ref name="Mirkin"/><ref name="Reardon-dogofdeath">{{cite video |people=Reardon, Jim |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season ''DVD commentary for the episode "Dog of Death"'' |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Several journalists have commented on the greyhound's lack of intelligence. In an article that compared ''The Simpsons'' to the animated series ''[[Family Guy]]'', Todd Camp of the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' noted that "though Santa's Little Helper may be the only Simpson who's dumber than Homer, [[Griffin family|the Griffins]]' pooch <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Brian Griffin]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> is the brainiest member of the household".<ref name=Camp>{{cite news |last=Camp |first=Todd |title=What a 'Guy' – New Fox cartoon mocks TV, 'The Simpsons' |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=1999-04-11 |page=2}}</ref> In 1991, [[Copley News Service]]'s Alison Ashton described Santa's Little Helper as a "sweet and stupid dog".<ref>{{cite news |last=Ashton |first=Alison |title=Questions that yule like – See how much you know about this time of year |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=1991-11-26 |page=NC-6}}</ref> Tom Coombe of ''[[The Morning Call]]'' wrote in 2002 that "fans of ''The Simpsons'' will tell you that the cartoon family's dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish. Fans of the real-life breed will paint a different picture — of dogs that are peaceful, affectionate, [and] not given to drooling, panting".<ref>{{cite news |last=Coombe |first=Tom |title=Furry friend raises cash for greyhounds – Group selling stuffed animals to help pay for adoption program |newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] |date=2002-01-21 |page=B5}}</ref>

Some ideas for episodes featuring Santa's Little Helper come from reality. The plot of "Dog of Death" was based on Swartzwelder's experiences with his own dog, which had also suffered from [[gastric dilatation volvulus|bloat]]. However, unlike the events in the episode, Swartzwelder's dog did not receive treatment as the operation was too expensive and the dog was too old.<ref name="Jean-dogofdeath">{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season ''DVD commentary for the episode "Dog of Death"'' |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> ''[[The Gold Coast Bulletin]]''{{'}}s Ryan Ellem commented in 2005 that the Simpson family's dilemma with the cost of the veterinary procedure is a realistic dilemma faced by many families who own dogs.<ref>{{cite news |title=All creatures great and small – Purr-fect cover for vet bills |last=Ellem |first=Ryan |date=2005-10-29 |work=[[The Gold Coast Bulletin]] |page=060}}</ref> Other episode ideas come from [[popular culture]]. For example, Santa's Little Helper fathering 25 puppies in "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" is a parody of the [[Disney]] film ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'',<ref name="Scully">{{cite video |people=Scully, Mike |date=2005 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season ''DVD commentary for the episode "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds"'' |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> and Mr. Burns' technique of brainwashing him into an attack dog in "Dog of Death" parodies ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/jul/16/stanleykubrick2 |title=Stanley and Bart... another Kubrick legend |date=1999-07-16 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=2011-03-01}}</ref> Susan McHugh, who teaches theories of animals, literature, and culture at the [[University of New England (United States)|University of New England]], wrote in her 2004 book ''Dog'' that, "remaining loyal to his unlikely saviours, the boy Bart and his father Homer, this greyhound has prompted satires of contemporary dog culture, from [[Barbara Woodhouse]]'s authoritarian training methods [in "Bart's Dog Gets an 'F{{' "}}] to [[Lassie]]'s flawless service to the status quo [in "The Canine Mutiny"]."<ref name=McHugh>{{cite book |last=McHugh |first=Susan |title=Dog |url=https://archive.org/details/doganimal00mchu |url-access=limited |year=2004 |publisher=[[Reaktion Books]] |isbn=978-1-86189-203-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/doganimal00mchu/page/n78 77]–78}}</ref>

===Sounds===
[[File:Dan Castellaneta cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dan Castellaneta]] currently voices Santa's Little Helper.]]
Although cast member [[Dan Castellaneta]] occasionally voiced Santa's Little Helper for [[bit part]]s,<ref name="Jean-dogofdeath"/> American voice artist [[Frank Welker]] most often provided the sounds of the dog and other animals on the show from "Bart's Dog Gets an 'F{{' "}}, which aired on March 7, 1991, to "[[Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily]]", which aired on October 1, 1995.<ref name="Vitti-doggetsF">{{cite video |people=Vitti, Jon |date=2002 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season ''DVD commentary for the episode "Bart's Dog Gets an 'F{{' "}}'' |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> He said on his official website in 2007 that he liked portraying Santa's Little Helper because the dog was a "sympathetic" character.<ref name=welker/> Welker has been praised by staff members for his performances on the show.

'Hmmm, Dan barks pretty good, and we are already paying him and he seems to like doing the dog thing... why do we need to pay Welker who comes in here, spends less than an hour, eats all the doughnuts, refuses to come to rehearsals... let's just give the damn dog to Dan!'"<ref name=welker>{{cite web |last=Welker |first=Frank |title=Ask Frank |url=http://www.mkbmemorial.com/FWHp/ask_frank.html#05 |publisher=The Frank Welker Homepage (official website) |access-date=2011-08-14}}</ref>

==Reception==
Santa's Little Helper has become a well-known dog because of his appearances in the series. A writer for ''[[The Grand Rapids Press]]'' wrote in 2002 that "we all know who Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] are—heck, most Americans probably recognize their pets, Santa's Little Helper and [[Snowball II]]".<ref>{{cite news |title=...

Among fans and critics, Santa's Little Helper has been mostly well received. He ranked seventh in a 2008 poll by ''[[Dog Whisperer]]''{{'}}s [[Cesar Millan]] that determined the "best-loved television dog of all time." Lassie ranked first in the poll.<ref name=Rollo>{{cite web |last=Rollo |first=Sarah |title=Lassie crowned top TV dog in poll |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a136892/lassie-crowned-top-tv-dog-in-poll.html |access-date=2011-08-17 |website=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2008-11-27}}</ref> In addition, he was voted the tenth favorite ''Simpsons'' character by readers of ''[[Simpsons Comics]]'' in the United Kingdom in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mayer |first=Nissim |title=Bart named favourite 'Simpsons' character |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a197578/bart-named-favourite-simpsons-character.html?locale |access-date=2011-08-18 |date=2010-01-19 |website=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> In a list of their top twelve favorite dogs from cartoons, comics, and animation, writers for ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]'' listed Santa's Little Helper at number six, writing: "We admire his upbeat nature even after having his legs broken by Mr. Burns and being abandoned by Bart for another dog, Laddie."<ref>{{cite news |last=Walker |first=Kevin |title=Top Dogs |newspaper=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date=2004-03-26 |page=24}}</ref> He also ranked 75th on Retrocrush author Robert Berry's list of "The 100 Greatest Dogs of Pop Culture History" in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |last=Berry |first=Robert |title=Year of the dog – The 100 greatest dogs of pop culture history |url=http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2006/dogs/ |publisher=Retrocrush |access-date=2011-08-17 |year=2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927095040/http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2006/dogs/ |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The character has attracted some criticism too, though. While reviewing the episode "Bart's Dog Gets an 'F{{' "}} in 2010, [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote:

<blockquote>"As cartoon dogs go, Santa’s Little Helper is spectacularly unspectacular. In a realm of aggressively anthropomorphic canines, some of whom, admittedly, have strong speech impediments, he doesn’t talk or wisecrack or engage in shenanigans. His abilities and powers begin and end with masticating, defecating, and regular napping. You know, just like a real dog. Consequently, episodes devoted to Santa’s Little Helper tend to be a little on the sleepy side, even the ''Simpsons'' Christmas special that launched the series."<ref name=Rabin>{{cite news |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |title='Bart's Dog Gets an F' |url=https://www.avclub.com/the-simpsons-classic-barts-dog-gets-an-f-1798166865 |access-date=2011-08-14 |newspaper=[[The A.V.
