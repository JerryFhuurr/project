[[The Reverend|Reverend]] '''Timothy Goren''' "'''Tim'''" '''Lovejoy, Jr.'''{{Sfn|Groening|2010|p=1165}} is a recurring character in the [[Animated cartoon|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is voiced by [[Harry Shearer]], and first appeared in the episode "[[The Telltale Head]]".

Rev. Lovejoy is the minister at The First Church of Springfield—the [[Protestantism|Protestant church]] (from a fictitious branch called "presbylutheranism") in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. Initially kind-hearted and ambitious, Lovejoy has become somewhat bitter and [[apathetic]] towards other people and religion because of [[Ned Flanders]]'s chronic, over-the-top [[scrupulosity]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
===Profile===
Lovejoy is the pastor of the [[Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism]] First Church of Springfield, which most of the show's characters regularly attend.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite episode |title=The Father, The Son & The Holy Guest Star|episode-link=The Father, The Son & The Holy Guest Star |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Warburton, Matt; Polcino, Michael |network=Fox |airdate=May 15, 2005 |season=16 |number=21 }}</ref> He attended [[Texas Christian University]].<ref>"[[Wedding for Disaster]]"</ref> He initially came to Springfield in the 1970s as an eager, enthusiastic, young man,<ref name="inmargewetrust"/><ref>In "[[Faith Off]]" he uses an electric guitar in the church to compete against Bart's faith healing musical show.</ref> only to become cynical and disillusioned about his ministry, mostly due to [[Ned Flanders]], who constantly pesters him with minor issues such as "coveting [[Maude Flanders|his own wife]]" or thinking that he "swallowed a toothpick".<ref name="inmargewetrust"/>

Lovejoy would deal with Flanders' concerns very briefly, so that he could return to playing with his [[Rail transport modelling|model trains]]. [[In Marge We Trust|At one point]], Lovejoy "just stopped caring",<ref name="inmargewetrust">"[[In Marge We Trust]]"</ref> but rediscovered the joy of helping others, though Ned still irritates him.<ref name="inmargewetrust"/> Lovejoy even suggests Ned join another religion, as he believes that "they are all pretty much the same". In the season two episode "[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]", Lovejoy helps Lisa with her family's [[illegal cable]] hookup.

His sermons vary between dreary recitations of more opaque parts of the [[Old Testament]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=Simpsons Bible Stories|episode-link=Simpsons Bible Stories |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Long, Tim; Doyle, Larry; Selman, Matt; Kruse, Nancy |network=Fox |airdate=April 4, 1999 |season=10 |number=18 }}</ref> to the occasional "[[fire and brimstone]]" about [[Hell]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart Sells His Soul|episode-link=Bart Sells His Soul |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Daniels, Greg; Archer, Wesley |network=Fox |airdate=October 8, 1998|season=7 |number=4 }}</ref> He disapproves of popular music, as shown in "[[Bart Sells His Soul]]" when Bart gets the congregation to sing "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]]" as an opening hymn; he punishes Bart for the prank by making him clean the organ pipes that he has "befouled".

===Acceptance for other religions===
Lovejoy demonstrates his acceptance for Hinduism when he performs a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] marriage ceremony for Kwik-E-Mart shopkeeper [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]]<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons|episode-link=The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Appel, Richard; Moore, Steven Dean |network=Fox |airdate=November 16, 1997 |season=9 |number=7 }}</ref> (though Lovejoy does not know much about the faith, referring to it in [[Homer the Heretic|an earlier episode]] as "Miscellaneous"), co-hosts a religious radio program with [[Krusty the Klown]]'s [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky|rabbi father]],<ref>{{cite episode |title=Like Father, Like Clown|episode-link=Like Father, Like Clown |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Kogen, Jay;Wolodarsky, Wallace; Lynch, Jeffrey; Bird, Brad |network=Fox |airdate=October 24, 1991 |season=3 |number=6 }}</ref> and admits evolution may be true. However, he does not tolerate [[Buddhism]], as when [[Lisa Simpson]] converted to it, he referred to her as "Marge Simpson's devil-daughter".<ref name="She of Little Faith">{{cite episode |title=She of Little Faith|episode-link=She of Little Faith |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Frielberger, Bill; Moore, Steven Dean |network=Fox |airdate=December 16, 2001 |season=13 |number=6 }}</ref> He also appears bitter about the tall [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church across the street, wanting to build a larger steeple, and when mentioning the other church, placing the emphasis on "[[urine|pis]]".<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart Has Two Mommies|episode-link=Bart Has Two Mommies |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Gould, Dana; Mercantel, Michael |network=Fox |airdate=March 19, 2006 |season=17 |number=14 }}</ref> He maintains two [[rolodex]]es – one for [[Christians]], and one for non-Christians.<ref>Episode #8F05 Like Father Like Clown, Airdate October 24, 1991</ref> While he seems to have originally accepted evolution, he later advocates for [[creationism]] at his church to beef up its membership.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Monkey Suit|episode-link=The Monkey Suit |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Burns, J. Stewart; Persi, Raymond S. |network=Fox |airdate=May 14, 2006 |season=17 |number=21 }}</ref>

He does not accept [[Roman Catholicism]] either, as he is shown brawling with a priest.<ref name="The Frying Game">{{cite episode |title=The Frying Game|episode-link=The Frying Game |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Polcino, Michael |network=Fox |airdate=May 19, 2002 |season=13 |number=21 }}</ref> He tells Marge that he might as well do a [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]] dance for [[Abraham Simpson|Abe Simpson]] when asked to give him the [[last rites]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer Simpson in: "Kidney Trouble"|episode-link=Homer Simpson in: "Kidney Trouble" |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Anderson, Mike B. |network=Fox |airdate=December 6, 1998 |season=10 |number=8 }}</ref> He also helps kidnap [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to keep him from converting to Catholicism.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Lovejoy also claims in "[[There's Something About Marrying]]"<ref>{{cite episode |title=There's Something About Marrying|episode-link=There's Something About Marrying |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Burns, Stewart J.; Kruse, Nancy |network=Fox |airdate=February 20, 2005 |season=16 |number=10 }}</ref> to various same-sex couples who arrive at his church to get married that "while I have no opinion for or against your sinful lifestyle, I cannot marry two people of the same sex anymore than I could put a [[hamburger]] on a [[hot dog bun]]" and tells them to "go back to behind the scenes of every [[Surrealism|facade of entertainment]]." When Marge objects, Lovejoy tells her the Bible forbids [[same-sex relationships]], but when Marge asks which book in Bible forbids it, he merely claims "The Bible" and then continuously rings the church bell after Marge continues to press him on the matter.

===Negative qualities===
Lovejoy has been shown to do things that would be considered sinful. Lovejoy has been known to exploit his congregation for money, brawl with a [[Roman Catholic]] priest,<ref name="The Frying Game"/> encourage his pet [[Old English Sheepdog]] to foul [[Ned Flanders]]'s lawn,<ref>{{cite episode |title=22 Short Films About Springfield|episode-link=22 Short Films About Springfield |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Daniels, Greg; Reardon, Jim |network=Fox |airdate=April 14, 1996 |season=7 |number=21 }}</ref> and implied that he once burned down his church for [[insurance]] money.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Joy of Sect|episode-link=The Joy of Sect |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=O'Donnell, Steve; Moore, Steven Dean |network=Fox |airdate=February 8, 1998 |season=9 |number=13 }}</ref> In "[[Whacking Day]]", he made up a passage in the Bible to attempt to convince Lisa that "even God himself endorses Whacking Day". In "[[The Joy of Sect]]", the episode in which the whole town of Springfield is deceived into joining a cult, Lovejoy kidnaps Homer with Groundskeeper Willie from the cult and hits him across the head numerous times hoping to knock him out. Also, when Lovejoy sees the spaceship emerge from the "forbidden barn" he throws his [[Clerical collar|religious collar]] on the ground. After it is revealed that the spaceship is fake, Ned Flanders notices his collar on the ground and informs Lovejoy, who picks it up and puts it back on.

Lovejoy is not always enthusiastic about the [[Bible]], calling it a "2000-page sleeping pill".<ref name="She of Little Faith"/> It is unsure if he even owns a Bible, as it was once said he borrows one from the library every week. Sometimes he holds strange positions on the Bible and makes theological errors. In "[[Secrets of a Successful Marriage]]," an episode that dealt with marriage counseling, Lovejoy and his gossipy wife, Helen, both recommend that Marge should [[divorce]] Homer. Marge objects to this, pointing out how the Bible has strict guidelines against things like divorce, but Lovejoy claims, "Marge, ''everything'' is a sin. ''(holds up the Bible)'' Have you ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not allowed to go to the bathroom." However, despite these opinions, he is still deeply knowledgeable about the Bible, being able to recite a random passage purely from memory after Homer mentioned its number.

===Family===
Lovejoy's wife [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Helen Lovejoy|Helen]] was originally portrayed as a moralistic, judgmental gossip, but in voice actress [[Maggie Roswell]]'s long absence, her character was seen but not heard. The Lovejoys' manipulative daughter Jessica was the focus of the episode "[[Bart's Girlfriend]]" where she was voiced by  guest star [[Meryl Streep]], but is otherwise rarely seen.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bart's Girlfriend|episode-link=Bart's Girlfriend |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Collier, Jonathan; Dietter, Susie|network=Fox |airdate=November 6, 1994 |season=6 |number=7 }}</ref>
Lovejoy's father is briefly shown in the episode "[[Bart After Dark]]" as an older version of Lovejoy (including clerical collar) who visits the Maison Derrière.

==Creation and reception==
[[Matt Groening]] has indicated that Lovejoy is named after Lovejoy Street (which in turn is named for Portland co-founder [[Asa Lovejoy]])<ref name=Oregon>Corning, Howard M.

''[[The Oregonian]]'', September 3, 1999.</ref> When the character was created, producer [[Sam Simon]] did not want Lovejoy to be a "cartoony hypocritical preacher" but rather "a realistic person who just happened to work as a minister," as recalled by writer [[Al Jean]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |last=Pinsky |first=Mark I. |date=2001 |title=The Gospel According to The Simpsons: The Spiritual Life of America's Most Animated Family |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00mark|url-access=registration |location=Louisville, Kentucky |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00mark/page/69 69]–70 |isbn=9780664224196}}</ref> By season eight, the show had begun to explore secondary characters with Lovejoy being the central character in the episode "[[In Marge We Trust]]" because, aside from being noted as "the pastor who didn't care", he had not had much character development.<ref name=commentary>{{cite video|people=Weinstein, Josh|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season DVD Video Collector's Edition commentary for the episode "In Marge We Trust"|medium=DVD|publisher=Twentieth Century Fox|date=2006}}</ref> Author Mark I. Pinsky writes of Lovejoy as "a foil in the series, personifying many of the failings of organized religion and Christian conservatism," and yet still a real human with faults and not simply evil.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> [[Harry Shearer]] has stated that his voice for the character is based on [[Ernest Angley]].
