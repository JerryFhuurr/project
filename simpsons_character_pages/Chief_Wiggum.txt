is a character from the [[animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'', voiced by [[Hank Azaria]]. He is the [[chief of police]] in the show's setting of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], and is the father of [[Ralph Wiggum]] and the husband of [[Sarah Wiggum]].

Gluttonous, irresponsible, and immature, Wiggum is often too lazy, cowardly, and corrupt to bother fighting crime. His more responsible subordinate officers [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Eddie|Eddie]] and [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Lou|Lou]] play the [[straight man|straight men]] to his shenanigans.

== Character development ==
His surname "Wiggum" is [[Matt Groening]]'s mother's maiden name and her parents were [[Norwegian Americans|Norwegian immigrants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/2007/08/the_real_people_behind_homer_s.html|title=The real people behind Homer Simpson and family|access-date=2008-01-19|first=Joseph|last=Rose|date=2007-08-01|website=[[The Oregonian]]|archive-date=June 9, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240609160601/https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/2007/08/the_real_people_behind_homer_s.html|url-status=live}}</ref> As "a conscious pun", Wiggum was designed to look like a [[pig]].<ref name=tvguide>{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|date=2000-10-21|work=[[TV Guide]]|first=Joe|last=Rhodes|url=http://simpsonsarchive.com/other/articles/flash.html|access-date=September 29, 2024|archive-date=September 12, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240912104153/http://simpsonsarchive.com/other/articles/flash.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="sprcon">{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |last2=Klickstein |first2=Mathew |author1-link=Mike Reiss|author2-link=Mathew Klickstein|title=[[Springfield Confidential|Springfield Confidential: Jokes, Secrets, and Outright Lies from a Lifetime Writing for The Simpsons]] |date=2018 |publisher=[[Dey Street Books]] |isbn=978-0062748034 |page=101|location=New York City}}</ref> [[Hank Azaria]] first based his voice for Wiggum on [[David Brinkley]], but it was too slow and he switched it to an [[Edward G.

== Biography ==
Many episodes have dealt with the back story of how Wiggum, despite his incompetence, occupies such a high rank in the Springfield Police Department. However, these jokes tend to contradict one another, as is typical with side characters on ''The Simpsons''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-simpsons-turns-30-a-big-milestone-for-gen-x-and-america|title='The Simpsons' turns 30 -- a big milestone for Gen X and America|first=Christian|last=Whiton|date=September 30, 2018|website=[[Fox News]]|access-date=September 29, 2024|archive-date=September 11, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240911014316/https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-simpsons-turns-30-a-big-milestone-for-gen-x-and-america|url-status=live}}</ref> Wiggum was temporarily promoted to [[Commissioner of Police]] for the [[Springfield_(The_Simpsons)#Location|state in which Springfield resides]] during the 2005 episode "[[Pranksta Rap]]".<ref>{{Cite web|first=Tony|last=Sokol|author-link=Tony Sokol|date=March 25, 2019|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-simpsons-season-30-episode-18-review-bart-vs-itchy-scratchy/|title=The Simpsons Season 30 Episode 18 Review: Bart vs. Itchy & Scratchy|website=[[Den of Geek]]|access-date=September 29, 2024|archive-date=July 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200723154619/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-simpsons-season-30-episode-18-review-bart-vs-itchy-scratchy/|url-status=live}}</ref> He also appeared on a Halloween novel depicting  [[Netflix]]'s   ''[[Stranger Things]]'' Chief [[Jim Hopper (Stranger Things)|Jim Hopper]].<ref>{{Cite web|first=Cydney|last=Yeates|url=https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/15/simpsons-spoof-stranger-things-treehouse-horror-xxx-10327565/|title=The Simpsons to spoof Stranger Things in Treehouse Of Horror XXX this Halloween|website=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=July 15, 2019|access-date=September 29, 2024|archive-date=July 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716162508/https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/15/simpsons-spoof-stranger-things-treehouse-horror-xxx-10327565/|url-status=live}}</ref>
