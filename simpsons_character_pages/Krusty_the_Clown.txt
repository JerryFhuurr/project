He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]]. He is the long-time [[clown]] host of [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson]]'s favorite TV show, a [[variety show]] consisting of various kid-friendly [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] and often highly violent cartoons, most notably ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show]]''. Despite his cheery onscreen persona, Krusty is actually a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway. He has become one of the most frequently occurring characters outside the main [[Simpson family]] and has been the focus of many episodes, namely some centering around his relationship with his former co-star [[Sideshow Bob]], who later became a major antagonist of the series.

Krusty was created by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] and partially inspired by [[James H. Allen|Rusty Nails]], a television clown from Groening's hometown of [[Portland, Oregon]]. He was designed to look like [[Homer Simpson]] (also voiced by Castellaneta) with clown makeup, based on the scrapped original concept of Krusty where Bart worships a television clown who is ironically his own father that he looks down upon; the idea of Homer playing the role of Krusty would eventually be explored in the Season 6 episode, "[[Homie the Clown]]". Krusty's voice is based on [[Bob Bell (actor)|Bob Bell]], who portrayed [[WGN-TV]]'s [[Bozo the Clown]]. Krusty made his television debut on January 15, 1989, in the ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "The Krusty the Clown Show".

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofsky was born in the [[Lower East Side]] of Springfield and is the son of [[Rabbi]] [[Hyman Krustofsky]]. Very little is known about Herschel's mother, aside from her name being Rachel and that she died when Krusty was around thirteen years old. Hyman strongly opposed Krusty's wish to become a [[clown]] and make people laugh, believing that it would distract Herschel from his religion, wanting the boy to go to ''[[yeshiva]]'' instead. However, Krusty performed [[slapstick|slapstick comedy]], obscuring this from his father. However, Herschel was performing at a rabbis' convention when one joking rabbi squirted [[carbonated water|seltzer]] on him, washing off his clown makeup. When Rabbi Krustofsky discovered Herschel was the clown onstage, he disowned his son and did not speak to him for 25 years. Krusty later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa Simpson.<ref name= "LFLC">{{cite episode |title=Like Father, Like Clown |episode-link=Like Father, Like Clown |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Bird, Brad; Lynch, Jeffrey |network=Fox |airdate=1991-10-04 |season=3 |number=6}}</ref>

It was later revealed that Krusty did not have a [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] service, because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by "acting up." Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies: a [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] gala which Krusty uses to stage a comeback after his show is cancelled, then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father.<ref name="TIAC"/> After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield, Krusty started his show biz career as a street mime in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]] ([[Elvis Presley]]'s birthplace).<ref name="KGB">{{cite episode |title=Krusty Gets Busted |episode-link=Krusty Gets Busted |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Kogen, Jay; Wolodarsky, Wallace; Bird, Brad |network=Fox |airdate=1990-04-29 |season=1 |number=12}}</ref> Krusty later discovers that he has a daughter named Sophie. He had met Sophie's mother Erin when Erin was a soldier in the [[Gulf War]] and he was entertaining the troops. After spending the night together, he prevented Erin from assassinating [[Saddam Hussein]] to protect his Saddam-themed comedy act. After that, Erin started hating clowns, and she kept their daughter a secret from Krusty.<ref name="ICP">{{cite episode |title=Insane Clown Poppy |episode-link=Insane Clown Poppy |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Frink, John; Payne, Don; Anderson, Bob |network= Fox |airdate=2000-11-12 |season=12 |number=03}}</ref> Krusty and Sophie bonded over time, and while not a full-time father, he is known to acknowledge her birthdays and  occasionally references his daughter publicly.

Krusty has his own show on Channel 6 in Springfield: ''The Krusty the Clown Show'', which is aimed towards a children's audience and has many followers, including Bart Simpson.<ref name="KGK">{{cite episode |title= Krusty Gets Kancelled |episode-link= Krusty Gets Kancelled |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1993-05-13 |season=04 |number=22}}</ref> Krusty has licensed the show to dozens of countries that produce localized versions, including [[Ireland]], [[China]], [[Jamaica]], and [[Romania]] with the original version being the least popular.<ref name="YS">{{cite episode |title= Yellow Subterfuge |episode-link=Yellow Subterfuge |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Cohen, Joel H; Anderson, Bob |network= Fox |airdate=2013-12-08 |season=25 |number=07}}</ref> Krusty's show has gone through various phases: a clip from 1961 presents the show as a serious [[talk show]] featuring Krusty interviewing [[AFL–CIO]] president [[George Meany]] on the topic of [[collective bargaining]] agreements, while a clip from 1963 shows Krusty interviewing [[Robert Frost]], then dumping a load of snow on the poet.

During the series, the ''Krusty the Clown Show'' is shown to be aimed almost entirely at children.

Krusty seems to retire from—and then get back into—show business repeatedly throughout his career.<ref>{{Cite web| last= Michelle |first= Kara| date=September 27, 2014|title=The Simpsons News: A Character Dies and Krusty the Clown Retires, Again| url= https://www.jubileecast.com/articles/7452/20140927/simpsons-news-character-dies-krusty-clown-retires-again.htm|access-date=1 December 2020|publisher=JubileeCast}}</ref> One of his retirements is almost made permanent due to just-[[parole]]d Sideshow Bob's latest scheme: wiring [[plastic explosive]]s to a [[hypnosis|hypnotized]] Bart and sending Bart onstage.

[[File:Krustytheclownshow.png|right|200px|thumb|Krusty finishes his show with a song.]]
Bart Simpson is one of Krusty's biggest fans. In the episode "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]" he declares, "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings," and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposes Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helps Krusty return to the air with a comeback special, reigniting his career,<ref name="KGK" /> and reunites Krusty with his estranged father.<ref name="LFLC" /> For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but almost immediately forgets about it — presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits as well as his general conceitedness — and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other.<ref name="LFLC" /> One summer, Bart enthusiastically attends Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp turns out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp is simply a franchise location to which Krusty has licensed his image. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty will show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brings in [[Barney Gumble]] with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushes Bart over the edge. He decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart.<ref name="KK">{{cite episode |title=Kamp Krusty |episode-link=Kamp Krusty |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Stern, David M.; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-09-24 |season=04 |number=01}}</ref>{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=128–129}}

Krusty is a [[Millionaire|multimillionaire]] who has amassed his fortune mostly by licensing his name and image to a variety of substandard products and services, from Krusty [[alarm clocks]] to Krusty [[crowd control barrier]]s.<ref name="HtC" /> Many of these products are potentially dangerous,<ref name="KK" /> such as Krusty's brand of [[cereal]], Krusty-O's, which in [['Round Springfield|one episode]] boasts a jagged metal Krusty-O in each box.

Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his [[cigarette]]s with [[United States one hundred-dollar bill|hundred-dollar bills]], eating [[condor]]-egg [[omelette]]s, spending huge sums on [[pornographic magazine]]s and [[call girl]]s, and losing a fortune [[gambling]] on everything from [[Horse racing|horse races]] to [[opera]]s and [[Sports betting|betting]] against the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].<ref name="HtC" />

Krusty is a hard-living entertainment veteran, sometimes depicted as a jaded, burned-out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to [[Problem gambling|gambling]], cigarettes, [[Alcoholism|alcohol]], [[Oxycodone|Percodan]], [[Pepto-Bismol]], and [[alprazolam|Xanax]].<ref name="MSGtW">{{cite episode |title= Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington |episode-link=Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Swartzwelder, John; Kramer, Lance |network=Fox |airdate=2003-03-09 |season=14 |number=14}}</ref> He instantly becomes [[depression (mood)|depressed]] as soon as the cameras stop rolling;<ref name="HtC">{{cite episode |title=Homie the Clown |episode-link=Homie the Clown |series= The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1995-02-12 |season=06 |number=15}}</ref> Marge states in "[[The Sweetest Apu]]" that, "off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man." Krusty appears to have used [[cocaine]], one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder under his nose; however, he explains that he was simply researching a part for a film in which [[Cameo appearance|he played himself]]. In his book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', author [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] describes Krusty as "the wizened veteran, the total pro" who lives the celebrity life. He is miserable but he needs his celebrity status.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=392–394}} In "[[Bart the Fink]]", Bart inadvertently reports Krusty for [[Tax evasion|tax fraud]] to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and, as a result, Krusty loses most of his money.

In "[[Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington]]", Bart convinces Krusty to run for [[United States Congress|Congress]] so that Krusty can introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agrees and runs on the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ticket. Although his campaign starts off badly, Lisa suggests that he try connecting with regular families. He does so, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term starts off badly, as he is completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With the help of the Simpsons and an [[Walter Mondale|influential doorman]], however, Krusty succeeds in passing his bill.<ref name="MSGtW"/>

His body features include a [[third nipple]], a veal-shaped [[birthmark]], and a scar on his chest as a result of having a [[pacemaker]] inserted into his heart after suffering from a [[heart attack]] on-air in 1986.<ref name= "KGB" />

==Characterization==
===Creation===
[[File:Krustys first appearance.png|right|200px|thumb|Krusty in his first appearance in the ''Simpsons'' short "The Krusty the Clown Show"]]
Krusty first appeared in "The Krusty the Clown Show", one of the [[The Simpsons shorts|''Simpsons'' shorts]] from ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' that first aired on January 15, 1989.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=15}} The character was partially inspired by TV clown "[[James H.

Krusty's appearance and design is essentially that of [[Homer Simpson]] with clown makeup.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |title='Simpsons' Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To 'Burns-Sexual' Smithers |access-date=July 29, 2007 |date=July 26, 2007 | first=Larry | last= Carroll |publisher= MTV |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071220140402/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml |archive-date=December 20, 2007 }}</ref> Groening said that "The satirical [[conceit]]<!--sic, please do not "correct" this without checking the source--> that I was going for at the time was that ''The Simpsons'' was about a kid who had no respect for his father, but worshipped a clown who looked exactly like his father", a theme which became less important as the show developed.<ref name="NPR"/> One concept initially saw Krusty being revealed as Homer's secret identity but the idea was dropped for being too complex and because the writers were too busy developing the series.<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://www.ew.com/article/2007/07/20/talking-about-simpsons |title=Talking about ''The Simpsons'' |date=July 20, 2007 |magazine= [[Entertainment Weekly]] | publisher= |access-date=April 5, 2008 }}</ref> There are two instances of the one assuming the identity of the other. In a [[Butterfinger]] commercial depicting a contest for $50,000 to find out who stole Bart's Butterfinger, a captured Homer appears to be the culprit until Maggie pulls off a mask, revealing Krusty. In the episode "[[Homie the Clown]]", Homer goes to Clown College and dresses up as—and is confused with—Krusty.

The Krusty character was originally conceived as just a normal man wearing clown makeup, but [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] noted that "at some point, we decided he looked [like a clown] all the time".<ref name= tvguide/> The producers had long discussions about whether or not Krusty would always remain in his clown makeup but eventually decided that it did not matter.<ref name="KGB"/> The writers had tried showing Krusty's real face a few times in early episodes, but decided that it did not look right, although his real face was seen in "[[Krusty Gets Busted]]" and "[[Like Father, Like Clown]]". Later episodes made jokes about Krusty's face. In "[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]", Krusty reveals that his "grotesque appearance" is the result of multiple heart attacks. Homer remarks that he seems fine, and Krusty replies, "This ain't makeup." In "[[Bart the Fink]]", he abandons an idea to sail away with a new identity and swims towards shore, leaving a trail of yellow makeup in his wake and his natural white face underneath. On shore, he shakes off his black hair, revealing his natural green clown hair, and removes his normal-looking fake nose to reveal his natural red bulbous clown nose underneath.<ref>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Carrington, Michael; Silverman, David |year=2004 |title=Commentary for the episode "Homer's Triple Bypass".

The [[The Simpsons season 3|third season]] episode "[[Like Father, Like Clown]]" is the first to establish that Krusty is Jewish. Krusty's religion had not been part of the original concept, the idea to make Krusty Jewish came from then head writer [[Jay Kogen]]. The episode is a parody of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which is about a son with a strict religious upbringing who defies his father to become an entertainer. In order to make "Like Father, Like Clown" a full parody of ''The Jazz Singer'', the decision was made to make Krusty Jewish and have his father be a rabbi. Krusty's real last name, Krustofsky, was pitched by [[Al Jean]].<ref name= "LFLCCom">{{cite video |people= Groening, Matt; Bird, Brad; Kogen, Jay; Wolodarski, Wallace; Jean, Al; Castellaneta, Dan; Kavner, Jean |year= 2003 |title=Commentary for the episode "Like Father, Like Clown".

This was shown in subsequent episodes like "[[Itchy & Scratchy & Marge]]" but the trait was dropped after the first few seasons because it was hard for the writers to write for an illiterate character.<ref>{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |year= 2002 |title=Commentary for the episode 'Itchy & Scratchy & Marge'.

Krusty's design has undergone several subtle changes since the early years. For the episode "[[Homie the Clown]]", Krusty's design was permanently enhanced and he was given a different shaped mouth muzzle and permanent bags under his eyes in order to distinguish him from Homer.<ref>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; Mirkin, David; Silverman, David; Kirkland, Mark |year=2005 |title=Commentary for the episode 'Homie the Clown'. The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> In the episode "[[Lisa's Wedding]]", which is set fifteen years in the future, Krusty's design was significantly altered to make him look considerably older and was based on [[Groucho Marx]].<ref name= "Daniels">{{cite video |people=Daniels, Greg |year=2005 |title=The Simpsons season 6 DVD commentary for the episode 'Lisa's Wedding' |medium= DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Krusty is a favorite character of several of the original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance for show business jokes. Thus, many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers.<ref>{{cite video |people= Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Reiss, Mike; Silverman, David |year= 2004 |title=Commentary for the episode 'Krusty Gets Kancelled'.

In 1992, [[Matt Groening]] and [[James L. Brooks]] began planning a [[live-action]] spin-off from ''The Simpsons'' that revolved around Krusty and would star [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Krusty.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mangels |first= Andy |date=January 1993 |title= Hollywood Heroes |journal=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] |issue=17 |page= 34 |publisher=[[Wizard Entertainment]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-simpsons-originally-planned-to-film-a-live-action-krusty-the-clown-spinoff/|title=The Simpsons originally planned to film a live-action Krusty the Clown spinoff| first=Bradley | last= Russell|date=April 27, 2021| website= Gamesradar.com|access-date=April 5, 2022}}</ref> They pitched the series in 1994.

A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by [[North American beaver|beavers]]. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart, and Groening decided to stop work on the project.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ew.com/article/1999/04/15/matt-groening-tells-ew-online-about-lost-simpsons-spin |title=Send in the Clown |date=April 15, 1999 |first=Dan |last=Snierson |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |publisher= |access-date=April 4, 2008 |archive-date=April 9, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409160510/https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84306,00.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Prior to Groening's live-action pitch, ''Simpsons'' showrunners [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] planned an animated Krusty spin-off in which he would be a single father in New York City.  Supporting characters would include a prickly make-up lady and a boss resembling [[Ted Turner]]. This unsuccessful pitch was later reworked into the animated series ''[[The Critic]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reiss |first1=Mike |title=[[Springfield Confidential]] |date=2018 |publisher= Dey Street |location=New York |isbn= 978-0-06-274803-4 |page=209 |edition= First}}</ref>
