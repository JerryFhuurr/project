He is voiced by [[Hank Azaria]] and first appeared in the second-season episode "[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]", which originally aired on May 9, 1991. Comic Book Guy is the proprietor of a [[comic book]] store, [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop|The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop]]. He is based on "every comic book store guy in America"<ref name=tvguide>{{cite news|title=Flash! 24 Simpsons Stars Reveal Themselves|access-date=September 1, 2014|date=October 21, 2000|work=[[TV Guide]]|first1=Joe|last1=Rhodes|url=http://www.simpsonsarchive.com/other/articles/flash.html}}</ref> and represents a stereotypical middle-aged comic-book collector with a supercilious attitude and obsessive knowledge of pop culture minutia. He is known for his distinctive accent, disagreeable personality, and his catchphrase, "Worst [thing] ever!"

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
===Profile===
Comic Book Guy (who states Jeff Albertson to be his real name in the episode "[[Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass]]"<ref name="nerve">{{Cite web|url= http://www.nerve.com/entertainment/2010/05/07/ten-times-the-simpsons-jumped-the-shark|title= Ten Times The Simpsons Jumped the Shark|last= Greene|first= James Jr.|date= May 6, 2010|access-date= January 12, 2012|publisher= Nerve.com|archive-date= February 20, 2012|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120220164739/http://www.nerve.com/entertainment/2010/05/07/ten-times-the-simpsons-jumped-the-shark|url-status= dead}}</ref>) is a nerdy, snobby and quarrelsome man. He is best known for his eloquence and crabby, sarcastic quips. He is obsessed with collecting comic books and is an avid [[science fiction]] buff. He holds a [[master's degree]] in [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] (having translated ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' into [[Klingon language|Klingon]] as part of his [[thesis]]),<ref>"[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]"</ref> as well as a degree in chemical engineering,<ref>[[Married to the Blob]]</ref> has an IQ of 170, and is a member of the Springfield branch of [[Mensa International|Mensa]].<ref name="LisasBrain">{{cite episode |title=They Saved Lisa's Brain |episode-link=They_Saved_Lisa's_Brain |series=The Simpsons |series-link= The Simpsons |credits= Selman, Matt; Michels, Pete|network=Fox |season=10 |number=22}}</ref> He is morbidly obese and has long hair, which he always keeps tied in a ponytail.

His catchphrase is the declaration "worst/best [subject] ever", sometimes to the point of breaking the [[fourth wall]]. For example, in the episode "[[Saddlesore Galactica]]", he wears a T-shirt saying "[[Worst Episode Ever]]". Another example of breaking the fourth wall occurs in an episode when Comic Book Guy's chair collapses, and he sarcastically says "Ooh, a fat man falls. ''Real'' original."<ref name=SaddlesoreGalactica/> Despite his solitary life, in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', minutes before his anticipated death, Comic Book Guy says that his obsessive comic book collecting has been a "life well spent". However, in "[[Treehouse of Horror VIII]]", when a nuclear missile homes in on him, he says to himself, "Oh, I've wasted my life", although the [[Treehouse of Horror (series)|''Treehouse of Horror'' episodes]] are not part of the normal ''Simpsons'' canon. In the 2008 episode "[[Any Given Sundance]]" it was revealed that he is also a writer and posts to his own site called "Ain't I Fat News", a take on the real-life movie review website [[Ain't It Cool News]].<ref>{{cite web|title=I AM COMIC BOOK GUY!!!|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/36621|access-date=December 12, 2012|date=May 7, 2008}}</ref>

===Romance===
Comic Book Guy was once married in an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|online role-playing game]]. He and his Internet wife contemplated having children, but that would have severely drained his "power crystals".<ref name="GeekWedding">{{cite episode |title=My Big Fat Geek Wedding|episode-link=My_Big_Fat_Geek_Wedding |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Curran, Kevin; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox|season=15 |number=17}}</ref> In Season 16's "[[There's Something About Marrying]]", he hopes to wed a ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' cardboard figure. While part of an intellectual [[wiktionary:junta|junta]] that briefly ran Springfield in "[[They Saved Lisa's Brain]]", he proposes plans to limit breeding to once every seven years (a reference to the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] blood fever of mating, called [[Pon farr]]), commenting that this would mean much less breeding for most, but for him, "much, much more".<ref name="LisasBrain"/> He was a [[virgin]] well into his forties,<ref>{{cite episode|title=Mayored to the Mob|episode-link=Mayored_to_the_Mob |series=The Simpsons |series-link=The Simpsons |credits= Hauge, Ron; Scott III, Swinton O. |network=Fox |season=10 |number=9}}</ref> but becomes sexually and romantically involved with [[Principal Skinner]]'s mother [[Agnes Skinner|Agnes]].<ref name=WorstEpisodeEver/> He later dates [[Edna Krabappel]] after she leaves Skinner at the altar.<ref name="GeekWedding"/> They are nearly married at a [[science fiction convention]] with Skinner and Bart trying to stop the wedding, but Edna changes her mind, preferring not to be tied down to a relationship. Comic Book Guy is not particularly surprised by this, saying, "There are a million valid reasons, but which one did you pick?"<ref name="GeekWedding"/> When Edna gently explains "It's like I'm [[DC Comics]], and you're [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]", he accepts the comparison without any rancor. In "[[Married to the Blob]]", Comic Book Guy marries [[Kumiko Nakamura]], a Japanese [[manga artist]]. As of "[[The Dad-Feelings Limited]]", he and Kumiko are trying for a baby.

===The Android's Dungeon===
{{Further|Springfield (The Simpsons)#The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop{{!}}The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop}}
[[File:Dungeon.gif|thumb|250px|The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop]]
Comic Book Guy is the owner of The Android's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop, a local comic book store. The comics, collectibles, and toys he sells are of wildly varying quality and often have very high prices. His store is his sanctuary, where he holds some level of self-esteem, imperiously lording over pre-teen kids, like [[Bart Simpson]] and [[Milhouse Van Houten]], using a heavily sarcastic tone and often banning certain customers for minor infractions. His store contains a lower level full of illegal [[video tape|videos]] (which include [[Fred Rogers|Mr. Rogers]] drunk, ''[[Alien Autopsy (1995 film)|Alien autopsy]]'', ''Illegal Alien Autopsy'', a "good version" of ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'', and [[Kent Brockman]] picking his nose).<ref name="WorstEpisodeEver"/>

In "[[Husbands and Knives]]", the store was closed due to bankruptcy when a rival comic book shop opened across the road, run by an owner with significantly better customer service and social skills. Although his old store was bought by [[Marge Simpson]] in the same episode and not returned, Comic Book Guy continues running his store in future episodes and the rival store is usually not mentioned, though it was referred to again when its owner showed up in "[[Married to the Blob]]". Also Bart and Milhouse became managers of The Android's Dungeon for a time in "[[Worst Episode Ever]]".

==Character==
===Creation===
Comic Book Guy was partly inspired by a clerk at the Los Angeles comic book shop who often "[sat] on the high stool, kind of lording over the store with that supercilious attitude and eating behind the counter a big Styrofoam container full of [[fried clams]] with a lot of [[tartar sauce]]."<ref name=tvguide/> Groening noted: {{cquote|I can't tell you how many times people have come up to me and said, "I know who you based that comic book guy on. It's that comic-book guy right down the block." And I have to tell them, "No, it's every comic book store guy in America."<ref name=tvguide/>}}

Azaria based Comic Book Guy's voice on a college contemporary named Mark who went by the nickname "F", short for "Flounder" from the film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', and lived in the room next door to him at [[Tufts University]]. Hank Azaria further explained that "F" would listen to the song "[[867-5309]]" all day long and that Mark would keep a list of top five and bottom five people whom he liked and hated in the dorm and post it hourly. Azaria stated that he himself was always on the bottom five of the list because he complained about the playing of the music.<ref name="F">Azaria, Hank (2004). Commentary for "[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Azaria "loves that the character is an adult who argues with kids as if they're his peers."<ref name=tvguide/>

===Development===
Within the series, the character Comic Book Guy is often used to represent a stereotypical inhabitant of the newsgroup [[alt.tv.simpsons]].<ref name="tossell">{{cite news |last=Tossell |first=Ivor |title=Worst.

In the [[The Simpsons season 8|eighth-season]] episode "[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]" after Comic Book Guy views the ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]]'' episode featuring Poochie, he immediately goes on the Internet and writes, "Worst episode ever" on a message board; a commentary on how the active audience nitpicks the episode. The writers respond by using the voice of [[Bart Simpson]]:<ref name="alberti">Alberti, pp. 147–148</ref>

{{cquote|
'''Comic Book Guy''': Last night's ''[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]]'' was, without a doubt, the worst episode ever. Rest assured I was on the Internet within minutes registering my disgust throughout the world.

'''Bart''': Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?

'''Comic Book Guy''': As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.

'''Bart''': What? They've given you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? If anything, you owe them!

'''Comic Book Guy''': ...Worst. Episode. Ever.<ref>David S. Cohen{{mdash}}''[[The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show]]'', ''The Simpsons''</ref>}}

The catchphrase further appears on his T-shirt in the [[The Simpsons (season 11)|eleventh season]] episode "[[Saddlesore Galactica]]",<ref name=SaddlesoreGalactica>{{cite episode |title=Saddlesore Galactica|episode-link=Saddlesore_Galactica|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Tim Long|Long, Tim]]; Kramer, Lance |network=Fox |airdate=February 6, 2000|season=11 |number=13}}</ref> and as the title of the [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelfth season]] episode "[[Worst Episode Ever]]".<ref name=WorstEpisodeEver>{{cite episode |title=Worst Episode Ever|episode-link=Worst Episode Ever|series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Larry Doyle (writer)|Doyle, Larry]]; [[Matthew Nastuk|Nastuk, Matthew]]|network=Fox |airdate=February 4, 2001|season=12 |number=11}}</ref> The catchphrase can also be used for describing other things by saying, "Worst. (Noun). Ever."<ref name="tossell"/>

===Name===
A long-running gag on the show was never to reveal the character's name, with other characters referring to him as "Comic Book Guy". The writers had intended to name the character as early as his first episode, but they could not think of a name for him, and they called him "Comic Book Guy", with the intention of naming the character the next time they used him.<ref name= ReissTMAACB>Reiss, Mike (2002). Commentary for "[[Three Men and a Comic Book]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> However, they continually procrastinated.<ref name=ReissTMAACB/> Finally, in the February 6, 2005 episode, "[[Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass]]", Comic Book Guy nonchalantly tells [[Ned Flanders]]: "My name is Jeff Albertson, but everyone calls me 'Comic Book Guy'".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Abughazaleh|first=Zeid|date=2020-11-10|title=The Simpsons: Yes, Comic Book Guy's Real Name Has Been Revealed|url=https://www.cbr.com/the-simpsons-comic-book-guy-real-name-revealed|access-date=2024-02-11|website=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Peeke|first=Dan|date=2020-05-25|title=The Simpsons: 10 Things You Didn't Know About Comic Book Guy|url=https://screenrant.com/simpsons-comic-book-guy-facts-trivia-information|access-date=2024-02-11|website=[[Screen Rant]]|language=en}}</ref> [[Showrunner]] [[Al Jean]] remarked: "That was specifically done to make people really mad. We just tried to pick a generic name. It was also the [[Super Bowl]] show. We did it so the most people possible would see it." Groening stated that he had originally intended him to be called Louis Lane and be "obsessed and tormented by" [[Lois Lane]], but Groening was not present when the writers chose the name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218115716/http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1565538/20070725/story.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 18, 2007|title="Simpsons" Trivia, From Swearing Lisa To "Burns-Sexual" Smithers|access-date=July 29, 2007|date=July 26, 2007|first=Larry|last=Carroll|publisher=MTV}}</ref> His name is also mentioned in ''[[The Simpsons Game]]''.
