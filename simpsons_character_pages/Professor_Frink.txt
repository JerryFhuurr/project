[[Professor]] '''John I.Q. Nerdelbaum Frink Jr.'''<ref name=toh14/> is a recurring character in the [[Animated cartoon|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He is voiced by [[Hank Azaria]], and first appeared in the 1991 episode "[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]". Frink is [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]'s [[nerd]]y scientist and professor and is extremely intelligent, though somewhat [[Mad scientist|mad]] and socially inept. Frink often tries to use his bizarre inventions to aid the town in its crises but they usually only make things worse. His manner of speech, including the impulsive shouting of nonsensical words, has become his [[trademark look|trademark]].

Frink was originally depicted as an evil scientist in "Old Money", since he was trying to secure funding for a [[death ray]]. When Azaria [[ad libitum|ad-libbed]] a voice for the character, he did an impression of [[Jerry Lewis]]'s Julius Kelp character from ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]''. The staff liked the voice and therefore changed Frink to be more like Julius Kelp, both in appearance and personality{{snd}}he became more nerdy, and went from evil to just mad. Lewis later guest-starred on the show as Frink's father in the 2003 episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]".

The professor has received acclaim from critics, particularly for his bizarre inventions such as the hamburger [[earmuff]]s, and he has appeared on many reviewers' listings of their favorite supporting characters from ''The Simpsons''. Frink has been featured in other media relating to the show, such as comics, video games, and [[The Simpsons Ride]], a [[simulator ride]] at [[Universal Studios Florida]] and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]]. The character's popularity has led to him giving the name to the computer programming language [[Frink (programming language)|Frink]].<ref name="frinktool"/>

==Character==
[[File:Hankazaria05.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hank Azaria]] voices Frink]]
Frink first appeared in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]" that aired on {{nowrap|March 28, 1991}}.<ref name=tvguide/><ref name=oldmoney/> In that episode, [[Grampa Simpson]] inherits $106,000 from his girlfriend when she dies. He eventually decides to spend it on people who are in need of money and holds interviews. In one of these interviews, Frink introduces Grampa to his latest invention, the Death Ray, claiming that "it is just a prototype. With proper funding I'm confident this little baby could destroy an area the size of New York City!" Grampa responds with "But I want to help people, not kill 'em!", to which Frink replies "Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications. You know my wife will be happy, she's hated this whole Death Ray thing from day one."<ref name=Money/>

In the original script, Frink appeared more evil.<ref name=oldmoney>Groening, Matt; Jean, Al; Kogen, Jay; Silverman, David; Wolodarsky, Wallace (2002). [[Audio commentary]] for "[[Old Money (The Simpsons)|Old Money]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> However, when cast member Hank Azaria [[ad libitum|ad-libbed]] a voice for Frink, he did an impression of [[Jerry Lewis]]'s character Julius Kelp from the 1963 film ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'', and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of that character. Julius Kelp is a nerdy, mad professor, albeit not evil, and is often unsuccessful with his experiments, so Frink became more like that as the show progressed.<ref name=oldmoney/><ref>{{cite news |title=Comedian Lewis recovering from heart attack |url=http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/zap-jerrylewismildheartattack,0,377757.story?coll=zap-movies-headlines |access-date=2010-08-02 |newspaper=[[Zap2it]] |date=2006-06-14 |archive-date=2006-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713043242/http://www.zap2it.com/movies/news/zap-jerrylewismildheartattack,0,377757.story?coll=zap-movies-headlines |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] told ''[[TV Guide]]'' that "He was just written as a mad scientist character until Hank did the voice, and suddenly he became this nutty professor persona.

Mark Hughes Cobb of ''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]'' named him his favorite secondary character from the show.<ref name="Tuscaloosa"/> ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''{{'}}s Robert Philpot called the professor one of the five best supporting characters on ''The Simpsons'', writing that "Springfield's mad scientist is a triumph of style over substance, with Hank Azaria giving him a ripoff Jerry Lewis voice that reminds you why we once thought Lewis was funny."<ref>{{cite news |last=Philpot |first=Robert |title=D'oh-boy! – 'The Simpsons ' marks its 300th episode of razor-sharp satire |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] |date=2003-02-15 |page=1}}</ref> On their list of the top twenty-five peripheral ''Simpsons'' characters, [[IGN]]'s Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brian Zoromski listed Frink at number fourteen, commenting that he fits nicely into the ''Simpsons'' universe "as the town's brilliant mad scientist."

Several critics have commented on Frink's inventions. Patrick Goss of [[MSN]]'s ''Tech & Gadgets'' wrote that "When it comes to gizmos, Frink is the king", and listed the Death Ray as one of the greatest gadgets featured in ''The Simpsons''.
